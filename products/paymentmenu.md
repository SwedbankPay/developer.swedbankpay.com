# PaymentMenu

PaymentMenu is designed for merchants who prefer a comprehensive, ready-to-use payment menu provided by our PSP. With this product offering, merchants can offer their customers a variety of payment instruments, ensuring a smooth and convenient payment experience. Our PaymentMenu supports multiple payment methods, allowing businesses to cater to a wider audience and increase sales. By integrating PaymentMenu, merchants save time and effort in developing and maintaining their own payment menu, while benefiting from our secure and reliable infrastructure.

## Key Features

- Wide range of supported payment methods and currencies
- User-friendly and customizable interface
- Seamless integration with your e-commerce platform
- Secure and reliable payment processing

## Implementation Methods

PaymentMenu can be implemented using the following methods:

### Redirect

With the Redirect method, we host the Payment UI on our side. The customer is redirected to our hosted payment page, where they can complete the payment using the provided payment instruments. After the payment is completed, the customer is redirected back to the merchant's website.

### Embedded Payment

In the Embedded Payment method, the merchant implements the Payment UI as an iframe on their own page. This allows the customer to complete the payment without leaving the merchant's website, providing a seamless user experience.
