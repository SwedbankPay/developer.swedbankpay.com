title: Trustly Payments – Redirect

## Introduction

*   When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
    purchase process, you need to make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with
    your Purchase information. This will generate a `payment` resource with a unique
    `id`. You will receive a **redirect URL** to a Swedbank Pay payment
    page (`redirect-sale` operation).
*   You need to redirect the payer's browser to that specified URL so that the
    payer can enter the payment details in a secure Swedbank Pay environment.
*   Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer's browser to one of two specified URLs,
    depending on whether the payment session is followed through completely.
    Please note that both a successful and rejected payment
    reach completion.
*   When you detect that the payer reach your `completeUrl`, you need to do a
    `GET` request to receive the state of the transaction, containing the
    `id` URI generated in the first step, to receive the state of the
    transaction.

## Step 1: Create a payment

{% include alert-callback-url.md api_resource="trustly" %}

To initiate the payment process, you need to make a `POST` request to Swedbank Pay.

## Trustly flow

This is an example of the Redirect scenario. For other integrations, take a
look at the respective sections. The sequence diagram below shows the two
requests you have to send to Swedbank Pay to make a purchase.

Swedbank Pay Trustly Payments uses the [`Deposit`][deposit] to perform
a payment. After this, the end-user will be presented with the returned `iframe`
URL in order to perform the payment with their prefered bank.
Once the user has completed the payment, Swedbank Pay will receive a
notification asynchronously from Trustly, hence why
the UI will initiate polling toward our back-end. The payment status after being
redirect to `completeUrl` will then indicate if the payment was successful or
not, or if the payment is still in progress. If the payment is still in
progress, when reaching `completeUrl`, the Swedbank Pay has then not received a
notification from Trustly that the payment has gone through yet.

## Options after posting a payment

Head over to [after payment][after-payment]
to see what you can do when a payment is completed.
Here you will also find info on `Abort` and `Reversal`.
