## Options after posting a payment

When you detect that the payer has reached your `completeUrl`, you need to do a
`GET` request on the payment resource, which contains the `id` of the `payment`
generated in the first step, to receive the state of the transaction. You will
also be able to see the available `operations` after posting a payment.

*   **Abort:** It is possible to abort the process if the payment has no
    successful transactions. [See the `abort`
    description][abort-description].
*   For reversals, you will need to implement the `reversal` request.
*   **If CallbackURL is set:** Whenever changes to the payment occur a
    [Callback request][callback-request] will be posted to the `callbackUrl`,
    which was set when the payment was created.

## Reversals

### Create reversal transaction

The `create-reversal` operation will reverse a payment and
refund the amount to the consumer. To reverse a payment, perform the
`create-reversal` operation. The HTTP body of the request should look as
follows:

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```http
POST /psp/trustly/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/reversals HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ page.api_host }}
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "transaction": {
        "activity": "Sale",
        "amount": 1500,
        "vatAmount": 0,
        "payeeReference": "ABC856",
        "receiptReference": "ABC855",
        "description": "description for transaction"
    }
}
```

The `reversal` resource will be returned, containing information about the newly created reversal transaction.

{% include transaction-response.md api_resource="trustly"
documentation_section="trustly" transaction="reversal" %}

### Inspecting the Reversal

The `reversals` resource will list the reversal transactions
(one or more) on a specific payment. The URI will be found on a `payment` that has a
succesful `sale` operation.
