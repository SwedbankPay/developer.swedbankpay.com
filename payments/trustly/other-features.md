## Create Payment

In Trustly Payments, you can create one type of payment and you can inspect and alter the details of the
individual transactions within the payment.

To create a Trustly payment, you perform an HTTP `POST` against the `payments`
resource. Trustly payments does currently only support the `Purchase` operation and `Sale` intent.
