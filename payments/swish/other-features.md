#### eCommerce

All international mobile numbers are supported. To be valid, the number input
must be with a country code prefix and consist of 8 to 15 characters. Digits are
the only characters allowed, and the regex used is `\\+[1-9]\\d{7,14}`. A valid
Swedish mobile number would be `+46739000001`, a valid Norwegian mobile number
would be `+4792345678`.

#### mCommerce

No number input is needed in the mCommerce flow. The payer's mobile number must
be connected to a Swish account.

### Problem messages

When performing unsuccessful operations, the eCommerce API will respond with a
problem message.
We generally use the problem message type and status code to identify
the nature of the problem.
The problem name and description will often help narrow down the specifics
of the problem.

### Error types from Swish and third parties

All Swish error types will have the following URI in front of type:
`{{ page.api_url }}/psp/<errordetail>/swish`
