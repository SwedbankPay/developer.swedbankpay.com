Swish is the main Swedish payment app for mobile phones supported by all Swedish
banks, making it one of the essential payment instruments for merchants
operating in Sweden. We offer both mobile phone and browser based purchase flows
on our redirect and seamless view platforms, in addition to direct API
integration and Payment Link. Using the direct API integration will put you in
charge of determining which device is being used, and whether the e- or
m-commerce flow is the most suitable. We will do this for you.

## Purchase Flow

The following is a quick presentation of the purchase flow when using the
redirect or seamless view. You can find in-depth descriptions of the separate
flows in the corresponding sections.

If you are using the e-commerce flow, the payer enters a Swish connected
phone on Swedbank Pay's payment page (redirect) or in the `iframe` (seamless
view) after the payment is created.

After pushing the pay button, the payer needs to open the Swish app and confirm
the purchase. If you are using the redirect option, the payer will be
redirected back to the merchant's site.

In the m-commerce flow, the payment page or `iframe` will only have a pay
button, and no number input. The Swish app will be launched automatically when
you push the pay button.

## Good To Know

### Payment Type

Swish is one of the instruments using one-phase payments. The `sale` is done
when the consumer successfully confirms in the app, capturing the funds
instantly. The `abort` operation is still available, but the `cancel` and
`capture` operations are not. The `reversal`, if needed, is done by the
merchant at a later time. Read more about the [different
operations][after-payment] and the [payment resource][payment-resource].

### Certificate

As a part of the setup, you will need a Swish certificate. There are two ways of
doing this. You can apply for Swish as part of [Swedbank Pay Settlement
Service][settlement-service]), and utilize the Swedbank Pay Technical Supplier
Certificate. A [Swedbank Pay sales representative][payex-mailto] can assist you
with this.

Otherwise, you can contact one of the following banks offering Swish Handel:
[Danske Bank][danske-bank], [SEB][SEB-swish], [Länsförsäkringar], [Sparbanken
Syd][sparbanken-syd], [Sparbanken Öresund][sparbanken-oresund],
[Nordea][nordea], [Handelsbanken][handelsbanken], in order to get an acquiring
agreement, a Swish alias and access to [Swish Certificate Management
system][swish-certificate-management-system].

### Demoshop

You can give Swish a go in our demoshop if you like. For redirect payments, you
need to toggle `paymentUrl` off, if you want to try seamless view, `paymentUrl`
must be toggled on. The external integration demoshop used for testing is set up
with the Merchant Swish Simulator, which enables you to test without using the
Swish App.
