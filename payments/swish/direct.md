                      body="Swish is a one-phase payment instrument supported by the
                      major Swedish banks. In the direct scenario,
                      Swedbank Pay receives the Swish registered mobile number
                      directly from the merchant UI. Swedbank Pay performs a
                      payment that the payer confirms using her Swish mobile
                      app." %}

## Introduction

* When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request towards
  Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information.
* The next step is to collect the consumer's Swish registered mobile number
  and make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay to create a sales transaction.
* Swedbank Pay will handle the dialogue with Swish and the consumer will have to
  confirm the purchase in the Swish app.
* If `callbackURL` is set, you will receive a payment callback when the Swish
  dialogue is completed.
* Make a `GET` request to check the payment status.

## Purchase flow

The sequence diagram below shows the three requests you have to send to
Swedbank Pay to make a purchase.

## Operations

The API requests are displayed in the [purchase flow][purchase] above.
Swish is a one-phase payment instrument that is based on sales transactions not
involving `capture` or `cancellation` operations.
The options you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation
set to value `Purchase` are listed below.

### General

{% include alert.html type="success" icon="link" body=" **Defining CallbackURL**:
When implementing a scenario, it is strongly recommended to set a
[`callbackURL`][callback-url] in the `POST` request. If `callbackURL` is set,
Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer has
fulfilled the payment." %}

## Create Sale transaction

This operation creates a sales transaction in the direct payment scenario.
This is managed either by sending a `POST` request as seen
below, or by directing the end-user to the hosted payment pages. Note that the
`msisdn` value (the consumer/end-user's mobile number) is required in this
request.
