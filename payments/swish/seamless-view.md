### Explainations

* ① When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request
  towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information.
* ② `view-sales` is a `rel` value in one of the operations, sent as a response
  from Swedbank Pay to the Merchant.
* ③ `Open iframe` creates the Swedbank Pay hosted iframe.
* ④ `Show Consumer UI page in iframe` displays the payment window as content
  inside of the iframe. The consumer can insert mobile information for
  authorization.
* ⑤ `Event: OnPaymentComplete` is when er payment is complete. Please note that
  both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a
  cancelled payment.
* ⑥ To get the transaction result, you need to follow up with a `GET` request
  using the `paymentID` received in the first step.
* ⑦ If CallbackURL is set you will receive a payment callback when the Swish
  dialogue is completed, and you will have to make a `GET` request to check the
  payment status.

### Payment Url

{% include payment-url.md
when="at the 3-D Secure verification for Card Payments" %}

## Seamless View Back End

When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
purchase process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your
Sales information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
`paymentID`. You will receive a **JavaScript source** in response.

### Intent

{% include intent.md swish-authorization=true %}

### Operations

The API requests are displayed in the purchase flow above.
You can [create a Swish `payment`][create-payment] with the [purchase][purchase] `operation`

### Purchase

A `Purchase` payment is a straightforward way to charge the card of the payer.
It is followed up by posting a capture, cancellation or reversal transaction.

An example of an abbreviated `POST` request is provided below. Each individual
Property of the JSON document is described in the following section.
An example of an expanded `POST` request is available in the
[other features section][purchase].

The key information in the response is the `view-sales` operation. You will need
to embed its `href` in a `<script>` element. The script will enable loading the
payment page in an `iframe` in our next step.

## Seamless View Front End

You need to embed the script source on your site to create a hosted-view in an
`iframe`; so that she can enter the required information in a secure Swedbank
Pay hosted environment. A simplified integration has these following steps:

1. Create a container that will contain the Seamless View iframe: `<div
   id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">`.
2. Create a `<script>` source within the container. Embed the `href` value
   obtained in the `POST` request in the `<script>` element. Example:

```html
    <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.dev.payex.com/swish/core/ scripts/client/px.swish.client.js"></script>
```

The previous two steps gives this HTML:

{:.code-header}
**HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Swedbank Pay Seamless View is Awesome!</title>
        <!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file -->
        <script src=<YourJavaScriptFileHere>></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">
          <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.dev.payex.com/swish/core/scripts/client/px.swish.client.js"></script>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Lastly, initiate the Seamless View with a JavaScript call to open the `iframe`
embedded on your website.

{:.code-header}
**JavaScript**

```js
<script language="javascript">
    payex.hostedView.swish({
        // The container specifies which id the script will look for to host the
        // iframe component.
        container: "swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page"
    }).open();
</script>
