After the payment is confirmed, the consumer will be redirected from the Swish
app to the `completeUrl` set in the [create payment request][create-payment].
You need to retrieve payment status with `GET`
[Sales transaction][sales-transaction] before presenting a confirmation page to
the consumer.

## Options after posting a payment

* **If CallbackURL is set**:Â Whenever changes to the payment occur a [Callback
  request][technical-reference-callback] will be posted to the `callbackUrl`,
  which was generated when the payment was created.
* You can create a reversal transactions by implementing the Reversal request.
  You can also access and reverse a payment through your merchant pages in the
  [Swedbank Pay admin portal][payex-admin-portal].

### Reversal Sequence

A reversal transcation need to match the Payee reference of a completed
sales transaction.

## Payment Resource

When a payment resource is created and during its lifetime, it will have a set
of operations that can be performed on it.
Which operations are available will vary depending on the state of the payment
resource, what the access token is authorized to do, etc.
A list of possible operations for Swish Payments and their explanation
is given below.

{:.code-header}
**Operations**

```js
{
    "operations": [
        {
            "method": "POST",
            "href": "{{ page.api_url }}/psp/swish/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/sales",
            "rel": "create-sale"
        },
        {
            "method": "GET",
            "href": "{{ page.front_end_url }}/swish/payments/sales/{{ page.payment_token }}",
            "rel": "redirect-sale"
        },
        {
            "method": "GET",
            "href": "{{ page.front_end_url }}/swish/core/scripts/client/px.swish.client.js?token={{ page.payment_token }}",
            "rel": "view-sales",
            "contentType": "application/javascript"
        }
    ]
}
```

{:.table .table-striped}
| Property | Description                                                         |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `href`   | The target URI to perform the operation against.                    |
| `rel`    | The name of the relation the operation has to the current resource. |
| `method` | The HTTP method to use when performing the operation.               |

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as
described here in the documentation.
Always use the `href` and `method` as specified in the response by finding the
appropriate operation based on its `rel` value.
The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of
the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the
request for the given operation.

| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create-sale`   | Creates a `sales` transaction without redirection to a payment page. `Msisdn` is required in browser based scenarioes.                     |
| `redirect-sale` | Contains the redirect-URI that redirects the consumer to a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page prior to creating a sales transaction.         |
| `view-sales`    | Contains the URI of the JavaScript used to create a Hosted View iframe directly without redirecting the consumer to separate payment page. |

## Swish transactions

All Swish transactions are described below. Please note that Swish does not
support [Merchant Initiated Transactions][unscheduled-purchase] for the time
being.

## Sales

The `sales` resource lists the sales transactions (one or more)
on a specific payment.

### Create Sales transaction

In browser based solutions the payers `msisdn` (mobile number) is required. This
is managed either by sending a `POST` request as seen below, or by redirecting
the end-user to the hosted payment page. The `msisdn` is only required for
browser based solutions. With mobile app based solutions, the consumer uses the
device that hosts the Swish app to manage the purchase, making `msisdn`
optional.

{:.code-header}

Host: {{ page.api_host }}
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "transaction": {
        "msisdn": "+46739000001"
    }

**In-app Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{

    "sale": {

            "number": 992309,
            "amount": 1500,
            "vatAmount": 0,
            "description": "Test Purchase",
            "payeeReference": "Postman1508747933",
            "isOperational": true,
            "operations": [
                {
                    "href": "swish://paymentrequest?token=<swishtoken>&callbackurl=<completeUrl>",
                    "method": "GET",
                    "rel": "redirect-app-swish"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The `operation` `redirect-app-swish` is only returned when using in-app flows.

The payment now contains a sale transaction with the status (state)
`AwaitingActivity`, meaning we are awaiting a response from Swish.
When the consumer confirms the payment a callback request will follow
from Swedbank Pay.

## Reversals

The `Reversals` resource list the reversals transactions (one or more) on a
specific payment.

### Create Reversal transaction

A reversal transaction can be created after a completed authorization by
performing a request to the `create-reversal` operation.
A [callback][technical-reference-callback] request will follow from
Swedbank Pay.

## Capture

Swish does not support `capture` as it is a one-phase payment method all
completed payments are captured.

## Cancel

Swish does not support `cancel` as `cancel` can only be used on two-phase
payments before they are captured or reversed.

## Recurring

Swish does not support `recurring` payments.
