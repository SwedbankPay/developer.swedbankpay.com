{% include jumbotron.html body="**Swish Payments Redirect** is where Swedbank
Pay performs a payment that the payer confirms using her Swish mobile app.
The consumer initiates the payment by supplying the
Swish registered mobile number (msisdn), connected to the Swish app." %}

## Introduction

* When the payer starts the purchase process, through a mobile device that hosts
  the her Swish app, you make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with the
  collected PurchaseÂ information. This will generate a payment object with a
  unique paymentID. You either receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page or a
  JavaScript source in response.
* You need to [redirect][redirect] the payer to the Redirect payment.
  The payment flow is identified as m-commerce, as the purchase is
  initiated from the device that hosts the Swish app.
* Swedbank Pay handles the dialogue with Swish and the consumer confirms the
  purchase in the Swish app directly.
* Please note that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion,
  in contrast to a cancelled payment.
* If CallbackURL is set you will receive a payment callback when the Swish
  dialogue is completed. You need to do a `GET` request, containing the
  paymentID generated in the first step, to receive the state of the
  transaction.
