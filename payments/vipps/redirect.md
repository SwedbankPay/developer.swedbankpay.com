{% include jumbotron.html body="**Vipps Payments** is a two-phase
payment instrument supported by the major Norwegian banks. In the redirect
scenario, Swedbank Pay receives a mobile number (msisdn)
from the payer through Swedbank Pay Payments. Swedbank Pay performs a payment
that the payer must confirm through the Vipps mobile app." %}

## Introduction

* When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request towards
  Swedbank Pay with the collected `Purchase` information.
* This will generate a payment object with a unique `paymentID`.
* You will receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page.
* You need to [redirect][reference-redirect] the payer to the Redirect payment
  where the payer must push the payment button.
  This triggers a `POST` towards Swedbank Pay.
* The payer is redirected to a Vipps payment page where he or she is prompted to
  enter their mobile number.
* Swedbank Pay handles the dialogue with Vipps and the consumer confirms the
  purchase in the Vipps app.
* To receive the state of the transaction you need to do a `GET`
  request containing the `paymentID` generated in the first step.

You redirect the payer to collect the payer's mobile number.

## Purchase flow

The sequence diagram below shows the two requests you have to send to
Swedbank Pay to make a purchase.
The links will take you directly to the API description for the specific
request.

### Intent

**`Authorization` (two-phase)**: The intent of the payment identifies how and
when the charge will be effectuated. This determines the type of transaction
used during the payment process. The intent of a Vipps purchase is always
`Authorization`. The amount will be reserved but not charged.
You will later (i.e. if a physical product, when you are ready to ship the
purchased products) have to make a [Capture][capture] or
[Cancel][cancel] request.

### General

  {% include alert.html type="success" icon="link" body="**Defining
`callbackUrl`**: When implementing a scenario, it is strongly recommended to set a
`callbackUrl` in the `POST` request. If `callbackUrl` is set, Swedbank Pay will
send a `POST` request to this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment.
[See the Callback API description for more
information](/payments/vipps/other-features#callback)." %}

## Operations

The API requests are displayed in the [purchase flow](#purchase-flow).
You can create a Vipps payment with the `operation` value set to `purchase`. See
the `purchase` example below.

### Purchase

A `Purchase` payment is a straightforward way to charge the the payer.
It is followed up by posting a capture, cancellation or reversal transaction.
