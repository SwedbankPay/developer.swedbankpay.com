## Purchase

Posting a payment (operation `purchase`) returns the options of aborting the
payment altogether or creating an authorization transaction through the
`redirect-authorization` hyperlink.
Use the expand request parameter to get a response that includes one or more
expanded sub-resources inlined.

```json
{
    "payment": {
        "operation": "Purchase"
    }
}
```

## Operations

When a payment resource is created and during its lifetime, it will have a set
of operations that can be performed on it.
Which operations are available will vary depending on the state of the payment
resource, what the access token is authorized to do, etc.
A list of possible operations and their explanation is given below.

```json
{
    "payment": {},
    "operations": [
        {
            "href": "http://{{ page.api_url }}/psp/mobilepay/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}",
            "rel": "update-payment-abort",
            "method": "PATCH"
        },
        {
            "href": "https://{{ page.front_end_url }}/mobilepay/payments/authorize/{{ page.payment_id }}",
            "rel": "redirect-authorization",
            "method": "GET"
        },
        {
            "href": "https://{{ page.api_url }}/psp/mobilepay/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/captures",
            "rel": "create-capture",
            "method": "POST"
        },
        {
            "href": "https://{{ page.api_url }}/psp/mobilepay/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/cancellations",
            "rel": "create-cancellation",
            "method": "POST"
        },
        {
            "href": "https://{{ page.api_url }}/psp/mobilepay/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/reversals",
            "rel": "create-reversal",
            "method": "POST"
        },
    ]
}
```

| Property | Description                                                         |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `href`   | The target URI to perform the operation against.                    |
| `rel`    | The name of the relation the operation has to the current resource. |
| `method` | The HTTP method to use when performing the operation.               |

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as
described here in the documentation.
Always use the `href` and `method` as specified in the response by finding the
appropriate operation based on its `rel` value.
The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of
the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the
request for the given operation.

| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `update-payment-abort`   | [Aborts][abort] the payment before any financial transactions are performed. |
| `create-authorization`   | Create an [authorization][authorization-transaction] transaction.            |
| `redirect-authorization` | Used to redirect the consumer to the MobilePay authorization UI.             |
| `create-capture`         | Creates a [capture][capture-transaction] transaction.                        |
| `create-cancellation`    | Creates a [cancellation][cancellation-transaction] transaction.              |
| `create-reversal`        | Creates a [reversal][reversal-transaction] transaction.                      |

## MobilePay transactions

All MobilePay specific transactions are described below.

## Authorizations

The `authorizations` resource contains information about the authorization transactions made on a specific payment.

{% include transaction-response.md payment_instrument="mobile-pay"
    transaction="authorization"%}

You can return a specific autorization transaction by adding the transaction id
to the `GET`request.

## Capture Sequence

Capture can only be perfomed on a payment with a successfully authorized
transaction.
It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount
than the authorized amount.
You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total
authorization amount.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Merchant->>PayEx: POST <creditcard capture>
  Activate Merchant
  Activate PayEx
  PayEx-->>Merchant: transaction resource
  Deactivate PayEx
  Deactivate Merchant
```

## Cancel Sequence

Cancel can only be done on a authorized transaction.
If you do cancel after doing a part-capture you will cancel the difference
between the captured amount and the authorized amount.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Merchant->>PayEx: POST <creditcard cancellation>
  Activate Merchant
  Activate PayEx
  PayEx-->>Merchant: transaction resource
  Deactivate PayEx
  Deactivate Merchant
```

## Reversal Sequence

Reversal can only be done on a payment where there are some captured amount
not yet reversed.

```mermaid

  Merchant->>PayEx: POST <creditcard reversal>
  Activate Merchant
  Activate PayEx
  PayEx-->>Merchant: transaction resource
