## Options after posting a payment

* **Abort**: It is possible to [abort a payment][technical-reference-abort]
  if the payment has no successful transactions.
* If the payment shown above has a completed `authorization`,
  you will need to implement the `Capture` and `Cancel` requests.
* For reversals, you will need to implement the `Reversal` request.
* **If CallbackURL is set**: Whenever changes to the payment occur
  a [Callback request][technical-reference-callback] will be posted to
  the `callbackUrl`, generated when the payment was created.

## Capture

The `captures` resource lists the capture transactions performed on a
specific payment.

{% include transaction-response.md payment_instrument="mobilepay" %}

## Create capture transaction

A `capture` transaction - to withdraw money from the payer's MobilePay - can be
created after a completed authorization by performing the `create-capture`
operation.

The `capture` resource contains information about the capture transaction made
against a MobilePay payment.
You can return a specific capture transaction by adding the transaction id to
the `GET` request.

{% include transaction-response.md payment_instrument="mobilepay" %}

## Capture Sequence

`Capture` can only be done on a authorized transaction.
It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount
than the authorization amount.
You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total
authorization amount.

```mermaid

    participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay

    Merchant->>SwedbankPay: POST <mobilepay capture>
    Activate Merchant
    Activate SwedbankPay
    SwedbankPay-->>Merchant: transaction resource
    Deactivate SwedbankPay
    Deactivate Merchant
```

## Cancellations

The `cancellations` resource lists the cancellation transactions on a
specific payment.

### Create cancellation transaction

Perform the `create-cancel` operation to cancel a previously created payment.
You can only cancel a payment - or part of payment - not yet captured.

| ✔︎   | └➔&nbsp;`payeeReference` | `string(50)` | A unique reference for the cancellation transaction. See [payeeReference][payee-reference] for details. |

The `cancel` resource contains information about a cancellation transaction
made against a payment.
You can return a specific cancellation transaction by adding the transaction
id to the `GET` request.

{% include transaction-response.md payment_instrument="mobilepay"
    transaction="cancellation"%}

### Finalize

Finalizing a preauthorized payment is done as a `PATCH`  after a successful
`Authorization` transaction has been created.
The common use-case for the finalize operation is to authorize the payment
(that has the preauthorization intent) and complete all payment related
activities as soon as possible - in order to complete (finalize) everything
server-to-server afterwards.
The only allowed activity is `Finalize`. To use the operation, you should
perform a `GET` on the payment after the user returns from the
`redirect-authorization` operation and find the operation
`update-authorization-finalize`.

| `authorization` | `object` | The object representation of the [`authorization` transaction resource][authorization]. |

## Cancel Sequence

Cancel can only be done on a authorized transaction.
If you do cancel after doing a part-capture you will cancel the different
between the capture amount and the authorization amount.

    participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay

    Merchant->>SwedbankPay: POST <mobilepay cancellation>
    Activate Merchant

    Deactivate Merchant
```

## Reversals

The `reversals` resource lists the reversal transactions performed on a
specific payment.

{% include transaction-response.md payment_instrument="mobilepay" transaction="reversal" %}

## Create reversal transaction

The `create-reversal` operation reverses a previously created and
captured payment.
