## Introduction

* When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
  purchase process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with
  your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
  `paymentID`. You will receive a **redirect URL** to a Swedbank Pay payment
  page.
* You need to redirect the payer's browser to that specified URL so that the
  payer can enter the credit card details in a secure Swedbank Pay environment.
* Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer's browser to - one of two specified URLs,
  depending on whether the payment session is followed through completely or
  cancelled beforehand. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment
  reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment.
* When you detect that the payer reach your `completeUrl` , you need to do a
  `GET` request to receive the state of the transaction, containing the
  `paymentID` generated in the first step, to receive the state of the
  transaction.

### Options before posting a payment

All valid options when posting a payment with operation equal to
`FinancingConsumer`, are described in
[other features][financing-consumer].

* An invoice payment is always two-phased based - you create an
  `Authorize` transaction, that is followed by a `Capture` or `Cancel` request.
* **Defining CallbackURL**: When implementing a scenario, it is optional
  to set a [CallbackURL][callback] in the `POST` request.
  If `callbackURL` is set, then Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to
  this URL when the consumer has fulfilled the payment.
  [See the Callback API description here.][callback]

## Invoice flow

The sequence diagram below shows the two requests you have to send to Swedbank
Pay to make a purchase.
The diagram also shows in high level,
the sequence of the process of a complete purchase.

## API Requests

The API requests are displayed in the [purchase flow](#purchase-flow).
You can complete the invoice payment with following `operation`
options:

* [Financing Consumer][financing-consumer]
* [Recur][recur]

Our `payment` example below uses the [`FinancingConsumer`]
[financing-consumer] value.

example seen below. The response given contains all operations that are
possible to perform in the current state of the payment.

If a `GET` method is used from `paymentUI` with a `paymentToken`, the following
operations can be returned, depending on state of the payment and the last
transaction.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

    "href": "https://example.com/cancelUrl",
    "rel": "redirect-merchant-cancel",
    "method": "GET"

### Operations

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as
described here in the documentation.
Always use the `href` and `method` as specified in the response by finding
the appropriate operation based on its `rel` value.
The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of
the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request
for the given operation.
