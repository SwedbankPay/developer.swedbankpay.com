* An invoice payment is always two-phased based -  you create an Authorize
  transaction, that is followed by a Capture or Cancel request.
* **Defining CallbackURL**: When implementing a scenario, it is optional
  to set a [CallbackURL][callback] in the request.
  If callbackURL is set PayEx will send a postback request to this URL when
  the consumer has fulfilled the payment.
  [See the Callback API description here.][callback]

## Payment Resource

{% include payment-resource.md payment_instrument="invoice"
showStatusOperations=true %}

{% include payment-transaction-states.md %}

## Create Payment

Within the invoice payments part of the eCommerce API, you can create four kinds
of payments ([FinancingConsumer][financing-consumer], [Verify][verify], and
[Recur][recur]), and you can inspect and alter the details of the
individual transactions within the payment.

To create a invoice payment, you perform an HTTP `POST` against the `payments`
resource.

There are four different kinds of payment that can be created. These are
identified with the value of the `operation` property. Each kind are documented
in their own section below.

## Verify

{% include alert.html type="neutral" icon="info" body="The `Verify` operation
lets you post verification payments, which are used to confirm validity of card
information without reserving or charging any amount." %}

### Introduction to Verify

This option is commonly used when initiating a subsequent
[recurring invoice payment][recur] flow - where you do not want
to charge the consumer right away.

### Verification through Swedbank Pay Payments

* When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer initiates a
  verification operation, you make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with
  your Verify information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
  `paymentID`. You either receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page or a
  JavaScript source in response.
* You need to [redirect][redirect] the payer's browser to that specified URL, or
  embed the script source on your site to create a [Seamless
  View][seamless-view] in an `iframe`; so that she can enter the payment details
  in a secure Swedbank Pay hosted environment.
* Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer's browser to - or display directly in the
  `iframe` - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment session
  is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note that both
  a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled
  payment.
* When you detect that the payer reach your completeUrl , you need to do a `GET`
  request to receive the state of the transaction.
* Finally you will make a `GET` request towards Swedbank Pay with the
  `paymentID` received in the first step, which will return the payment result
  and a `paymentToken` that can be used for subsequent [recurring
  server-to-server based payments][recur].

### Screenshots

You will redirect the consumer/end-user to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect
the payment information.

Pay to make a purchase. The links will take you directly to the API description
for the specific request. The diagram also shows in high level, the sequence of

problem message. We generally use the problem message `type` and `status` code
to identify the nature of the problem. The problem `name` and `description` will
often help narrow down the specifics of the problem.
