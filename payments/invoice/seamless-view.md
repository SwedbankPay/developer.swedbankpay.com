{% include jumbotron.html body="The Seamless View scenario represents the
                                opportunity to implement Invoice directly in
                                your webshop." %}

## Introduction

Seamless View provides an integration of the payment process directly on your
website. This solution offers a smooth shopping experience with Swedbank Pay
payment pages seamlessly integrated in an `iframe` on your website. The costumer
does not need to leave your webpage, since we are handling the payment in the
`iframe` on your page.

## Purchase Flow

The sequence diagram below shows a high level description of the
invoice process.

Note that the invoice will not be created/distributed before you have
made a `capture` request." %}

The Capture/Cancel/Reversal options are described in the [after payment
section][after-payment]. The link will take you directly to the API descriptions
for the requests.

### Explainations

* ① Start with collecting all purchase information and make a `POST` request
  towards Swedbank Pay to create an invoice payment. Use the `FinancingConsumer`
  operation.
* ② The response from the payment resource contains operations that can be
  performed on the resource. The relevant operation in our example is `rel:
  view-authorization`.
* ③ `Open iframe` creates the Swedbank Pay hosted iframe.
* ④ To create the authorization transaction, you need to make a second `POST`
  request where you send in the consumer data. Use the `FinancingConsumer`
  activity
* ⑤ To get the authorization result, you need to follow up with a `GET` request
  using the paymentID received in the first step.

* Finally, when you are ready to ship your order, you will have to make a `POST`
  request to make a [Capture][capture]. **At this point Swedbank Pay will
  generate the invoice to the consumer.**

## API requests

The API requests are displayed in the [invoice flow](#invoice-flow). The options
you can choose from when creating a payment with key operation set to Value
`FinancingConsumer` are listed below.

* An invoice payment is always two-phased based - you create an
  [`Authorize`][authorize] transaction, that is followed by a
  [`Capture`][capture] or [`Cancel`][cancel] request.
* **Defining CallbackURL**: When implementing a scenario, it is optional to set
  a [CallbackURL][callback] in the `POST` request. If callbackURL is set
  Swedbank Pay will send a postback request to this URL when the consumer has
  fulfilled the payment. [See the Callback API description here.][callback]

## Seamless View Back End

When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
invoice process, you need to make a POST request towards Swedbank Pay with your
invoice information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
`paymentID`. You will receive a **JavaScript source** in response.

### Options before posting a payment

Different countries have different values for the properties. The table below
showcase the values for the respective countries:

#### POST Request Options

### Intent

{% include intent.md %}

### Operations

The API requests are displayed in the purchase flow above.
You can [create an invoice `payment`][create-payment] with following `operation`
options:

* [FinancingConsumer][financing-consumer] (We use this value in our examples)
* [Recur][recur]
* [Verify][verify]

### FinancingConsumer

A `FinancingConsumer` payment is a straightforward way to invoice a
payer. It is followed up by posting a capture, cancellation or reversal
transaction.

An example of an abbreviated `POST` request is provided below. Each individual
Property of the JSON document is described in the following section.
An example of an expanded `POST` request is available in the
[other features section][financing-consumer].

The key information in the response is the `view-authorization` operation. You
will need to embed its `href` in a `<script>` element. The script will enable
loading the payment page in an `iframe` in our next step.

## Seamless View Front End

You need to embed the script source on your site to create a hosted-view in an
`iframe`; so that she can enter the payment details in a secure Swedbank Pay
hosted environment. A simplified integration has these following steps:

1. Create a container that will contain the Seamless View iframe: `<div
   id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">`.
2. Create a `<script>` source within the container. Embed the `href` value
   obtained in the `POST` request in the `<script>` element. Example:

```html
    <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.dev.payex.com/invoice/core/ scripts/client/px.invoice.client.js"></script>
```

The previous two steps gives this HTML:

{:.code-header}
**HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Swedbank Pay Seamless View is Awesome!</title>
        <!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file -->
        <script src=<YourJavaScriptFileHere>></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">
          <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.dev.payex.com/invoice/core/scripts/client/px.invoice.client.js"></script>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Lastly, initiate the Seamless View with a JavaScript call to open the `iframe`
embedded on your website.

{:.code-header}
**JavaScript**

```js
<script language="javascript">
    payex.hostedView.invoice({
        // The container specifies which id the script will look for to host the
        // iframe component.
        container: "swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page"
    }).open();
</script>
```
