## Card Payments in Mobile Apps

The implementation sequence for Card Payments in mobile apps
is identical to the standard
Redirect scenario, but also includes explanations of how to include this
redirect in mobile apps or in mobile web pages.

### Screenshots for Payments

You will redirect the consumer/end-user to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect
the card information.

## API Requests for Payments

The API requests are displayed in the [purchase flow][purchase].
You can [create a card `payment`][create-payment] with following `operation`
options:

*   [`Purchase`][purchase]
*   [`Recur`][recur]
*   [`Payout`][payout]
*   [`Verify`][verify]

Our `payment` example below uses the [`Purchase`][purchase] value.

## Purchase flow mobile

The sequence diagram below shows a high level description of a complete
purchase, and the two requests you have to send to Swedbank Pay. The links will
take you directly to the corresponding API description.

When dealing with card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the
cardholder is an essential topic. There are two alternative outcomes of a credit
card payment:

*   3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank
  Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the
  issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no
  authentication of the cardholder is done.
*   Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank
  Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is
  decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile
  BankID.
