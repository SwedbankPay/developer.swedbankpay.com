                      This option allow you to collect the card data on your
                      page. That implies that the process must be [PCI-DSS
                      Compliant](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/)" %}

*   When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
  purchase process, you need to make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with
  your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
  `paymentID`. You either receive a Redirect URL to a Swedbank Pay hosted
  page (Redirect integration) or a JavaScript source in response (Seamless View
  integration).
*   You need to [redirect][redirect] the payer's browser to that specified URL,
    or embed the script source on your site to create a Hosted View in an
    `iframe`; so that the payer can enter the credit card details in a secure
    Swedbank Pay hosted environment.
*   Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication when this is required.
*   Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer's browser to - or display directly in
    the `iframe` - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment
    session is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note
    that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to
    a cancelled payment.
*   When you detect that the payer reach your `completeUrl` , you need to do a
  `GET` request, containing the `id` of the payment generated in the first step,
  to receive the state of the transaction.

You will redirect the payer to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect the credit
card information.

When dealing with card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the
cardholder is an essential topic. There are three alternative outcome of a
card payment:

*   3-D Secure enabled - by default, 3-D Secure should be enabled, and Swedbank
    Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure. This depends on the
    issuer of the card. If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no
    authentication of the cardholder is done.
*   Card supports 3-D Secure - if the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank
    Pay will redirect the cardholder to the autentication mechanism that is
    decided by the issuing bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or
    Mobile BankID.
