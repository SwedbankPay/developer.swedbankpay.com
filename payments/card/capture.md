**Et voilà!** The payment should now be complete, secure and
everyone should be happy. But, sometimes you also need to implement the
cancellation and reversal operations described in After Payment.

{% include iterator.html prev_href="direct"
                         prev_title="Back: Direct"
                         next_href="after-payment"
                         next_title="Next: After Payment" %}
