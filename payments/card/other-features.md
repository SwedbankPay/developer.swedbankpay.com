## Co-badge Card Choice for Dankort

Due to new [EU regulations from 2016-06-09][eu-regulation] regarding cards that 
have more than one payment application, we have developed support for the end 
users of Dankort to be able to choose their preferred payment application on the
Swedbank Pay payment page. If you are a Dankort user, read more about this
feature at [Dankort][dankort-eu].

As a merchant you are able to set a priority selection of payment application by
contacting [Swedbank Pay Support][swedbankpay-support]. The end user will always
be able to override this priority selection on the payment page.

If you want more information about Co-badge Card Choice for Dankort users please
contact [Swedbank Pay Support][swedbankpay-support]. The example below shows the
payment window where there payer can choose between Dankort or Visa before
completing the payment.
