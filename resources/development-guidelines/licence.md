## Licensing

The licensing of PayExâ€™ open source software should be one approved by the
[Open Source Initiative][open-source-initiative] and preferably one that is
compatible with closed source, enterprise software. The
[MIT License][mit-license] is therefore a good fit and should be chosen when
possible:
