| **Account Receivable Consumer** | The [`AccountReceivableConsumer`][invoice-url] API is the fundament for Swedbank Pay [Invoice Payments][invoice-url] service. It is a service where Swedbank Pay helps produce and distribute invoices to payers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Authorization**               | The first part of a [two-phase][fundamentals] transaction where a certain amount is blocked on the payer's account. The authorized amount is unavailable for the payer, ensuring that the merchant receives the money during the subsequent capture phase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Callback**                    | If `callbackURL` is set, a [Callback][callback-url] is triggered when a change or update from the back-end system is made on a payment or transaction. Swedbank Pay performs an async callback to inform the payee/merchant about this kind of update.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Cancellation**                | Used to [cancel][cancel-url] authorized and not yet captured transactions. If a cancellation is performed after doing a part-capture, it will only affect the not yet captured authorization amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Capture**                     | The second part of a [two-phase][fundamentals] transaction where the authorized amount is sent from the payer to the payee. It is possible to do a part-capture on a subset of the authorized amount. Several captures on the same payment are possible, up to the total authorization amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Checkin**                     | Checkin is the first part of the Swedbank Pay [Checkout][checkout-url] flow (prior to displaying the Payment Menu), where the payer is identified by email and mobile phone number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Consumer**                    | The person doing the purchase, equivalent to Payer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### H

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Header**                      | An `HTTP` header used to carry information when doing an API Request. All API requests share some [common headers][common-headers].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### I

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Intent**                      | An `intent` is a payment parameter that determine the possible activity states available for a payment option (e.g. Purchase). Intents differ depening on payment instrument. Creating a payment within a [one-phase][fundamentals] payment flow (Swish, Direct debit) must have the intent to create a [Sale][fundamentals]. This is in contrast to a [two-phase][fundamentals] payment flow that have the intent to create an [Authorization][fundamentals]. Card payments also have specific intents that determine whether an [`AutoCapture`][auto-capture] is implemented (the credit card is charged directly like one-phase transaction). |

### O

{:.table .table-striped}
| **One-phase payment flow**      | A [one-phase][fundamentals] payment is a payment done in one step. The amount is settled in one transactional step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Operation**                   | A  payment operation determines what kind of payment that should be implemented. Available payment operations vary, depending on payment instrument. The most common operation all instruments share is the Purchase operation. Card Payments have several others, such  as [Payout][payout], [Verify][verify-url] and [Recur][recur].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Operations**                  | Operations consist of an array of contextual links / actions that direct the payment flow in a given state of the payment resource (i.e. creating a capture transaction, creating a reversal transaction, returning a redirect URL, etc). Operations are [HATEOAS][hateoas] driven and managed through API calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
