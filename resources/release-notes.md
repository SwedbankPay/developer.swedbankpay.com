### Version 3.0.0

It's been a minute, but the day is finally here. We can proudly present Checkout
version 3.0! The same range of payment instruments, checkin options and features
as always, but since different merchants have different needs, we've made it
easier for you to get the checkout experience which fits you best. So, what's
new?

*   Four Checkout implementations tailor-made for different needs and wishes:
    Starter, Business, Enterprise or Payments Only. We've summed them up to help
    you find the right fit and [get started][get-started].
*   Each implementation starts off with a guide to set up your test account
    quickly.
*   Want to see the new implementations in action? Head over to the
    [demoshop][demoshop].
*   We've put the [sequence diagrams][sequence-diagrams] in a separate section.
*   The [Seamless View events][seamless-view-events] have been re-worked to make
    the integration smoother for you.
*   Renamed and gathered the Post Purchase options on one page. The rest of the
    features are still where they used to be.
*   We've given the [front page][frontpage] a touch up, and given the new
    sections a slightly different look to distinguish them.
*   Already up on Checkout version 2.0? No worries. All the documentation is
    still available in the sidebar and [here][checkout-v2].

`language`. Supported languages are Norwegian, Swedish and English. Consumers
outside Sweden and Norway can now purchase in our Checkout service. You can
specify supported countries for shipment in a new input parameter,
`shippingAddressRestrictedToCountryCodes`, in our checkin module.
Updated API specification can be found [here][initiate-consumer-session].
The parameters `language` and `shippingAddressRestrictedToCountryCodes` have replaced the former `consumerCountryCode`.

The parameters `msisdn` and `email` have been made obsolete due to GDPR rules. This information cannot be sent in without the explicit consent of the payer.

{% comment %}
TODO: Release this when the Swish Redirect section is released with the correct screenshot. Change the link below when this is ready.

### Improved purchase experience in Swish

We now show the flag connected to the origin of the phone number the payer
uses in Swish during payment. See updated screenshot of payment pages in [[Swish
ecom
redirect>>doc:Main.ecommerce.payex-payment-instruments.swish-payments.swish-e-commerce-redirect.WebHome]]
model.
{% endcomment %}

## 01 Nov 2019

### Welcome, Swedbank Pay Developer Portal

PayEx' Commerce offerings are being rebranded to **Swedbank Pay**   and as a
result of that rebranding, PayEx Checkout is now known as Swedbank Pay Checkout
and its documentation can be found on [here][checkout].

{% comment %}

TODO: Ref discussion about the m-commerce flow. Should we expose this feature
given the challenges we have?

### Support m-com flow for Swish payments

We have added support for m-com flow in
[[Swish>>doc:Main.ecommerce.technical-reference.core-payment-resources.swish-payments.WebHome]].
In redirect flow this is supported without any changes in your integration. But
a configuration on your swish agreement needs to be updated. Contact our support
in order to activate this.

If you use our seamless view-solution we have added the URL field called
paymentUrl (previously added for CreditCard, Vipps and Payment Order), that will
be used when the user is returned from the Swish application. See further
information regarding paymentUrl at: [[PaymentUrl in
CreditCard>>doc:Main.ecommerce.release-information.WebHome||anchor="HPaymentUrlCreditCard"]]
{% endcomment %}

### Support international phone numbers in Swish

We have added support for sending in international phone numbers in the request.
Check our Swish documentation [here][swish-features].
This is supported in API, and when payer's enter their phone number on the
payment page.

### Order Items

The input parameter `quantity` in the `orderItems` field is now updated to decimal.
You may send up to 4 decimals. See updated documentation
[here][payment-orders]

{% comment %} TODO: This is currently only used by ICA. Should we have the
documentation available? Check Jira-task DX-511.

### Payment order

We have added support for restricting payment instruments available in payment
menu. The input parameter is ##restrictedToInstruments## in Payment order. See
updated documentation
[[here>>doc:Main.ecommerce.technical-reference.payment-orders-resource.WebHome]]
{% endcomment %}

## 01 Oct 2019

### Payment Url Credit Card

We have added the URL field called `paymentUrl` for [Card
Seamless View][card-payment-url] (previously added for Vipps and Checkout), that will be used
when the user is returned from 3rd party. The URL should represent the page in
where the payment Seamless View was hosted originally, such as the checkout page,
shopping cart page, or similar. Basically, `paymentUrl` should be set to the
same URL as that of the page where the JavaScript for the hosted payment view
was added, in order to initiate the payment. Please note that the `paymentUrl`
must be able to invoke the same JavaScript URL from the same Payment as the one
that initiated the payment originally, so it should include some sort of state
identifier in the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping
cart or similar that has the URL of the Payment stored. When the JavaScript is
invoked after return of the payer, he or she will either be redirected to
the `completeUrl` (event onPaymentCompleted) or if payment has failed, see an
error-message and get the option to retry the payment.

## 01 Aug 2019

### Order Items in payment orders

On [Payment Orders][payment-orders],
`itemDescriptions` and `vatSummary` has been replaced with the more
versatile and powerful `orderItems`. While `itemDescriptions` will continue
to work, it is recommended that all integrations switch over to `orderItems`
as soon as possible. When `orderItems` is used, `itemDescriptions` must be
removed from all requests as the two cannot be used simultaneously.

### Payment Url

For our Seamless Views (currently [Vipps][vipps-payment-url] or in
[Checkout][checkout-payment-url]), we have added a new URL field called
`paymentUrl` that will be used when user is returned from 3rd party. The URL
should represent the page of where the payment seamless view was hosted
originally, such as the checkout page, shopping cart page, or similar.
Basically, `paymentUrl` should be set to the same URL as that of the page where
the JavaScript for the hosted payment view was added to in order to initiate the
payment. Please note that the `paymentUrl` must be able to invoke the same
JavaScript URL from the same Payment or Payment Order as the one that initiated
the payment originally, so it should include some sort of state identifier in
the URL. The state identifier is the ID of the order, shopping cart or similar
that has the URL of the Payment or Payment Order stored. When the JavaScript is
invoked after return of the payer, he or she will either be redirected to the
`completeUrl`, or, if payment failed, see an error message and get the option
to retry the payment.

If `paymentUrl` is not implemented, retry of payments will not be possible in
either individual payment instruments such as
[Vipps][vipps-payment-resource]
or in [Checkout][payment-orders].
It makes it more tedious to retry payment as the whole process including the
creation of the payment or payment order needs to be performed again. With
paymentUrl in place, the retry process becomes much more convenient for both the
integration and the payer.
