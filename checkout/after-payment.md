## Operations

Most payment methods are two-phase payments –
in which a successful paymentorder will result in an authorized transaction –
that must be followed up by a capture or cancellation transaction in a later
stage. One-phase payments like Swish are settled directly without the option to
capture or cancel. For a full list of the available operations, see the
[techincal reference][payment-order-operations].

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Operation**                          | **Description**        |
| `update-paymentorder-updateorder`  | [Updates the order](#update-order) with a change in the `amount` and/or `vatAmount`.       |
| `create-paymentorder-capture`      | The second part of a two-phase transaction where the authorized amount is sent from the payer to the payee. It is possible to do a part-capture on a subset of the authorized amount. Several captures on the same payment are possible, up to the total authorization amount. |
| `create-paymentorder-cancellation` | Used to cancel authorized and not yet captured transactions. If a cancellation is performed after doing a part-capture, it will only affect the not yet captured authorization amount.                                                                                         |
| `create-paymentorder-reversal`     | Used to reverse a payment. It is only possible to reverse a payment that has been captured and not yet reversed.                                                                                                                                                               |

To identify the operations that are available we need to do a `GET` request against the URI of `paymentorder.id`:

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```http
GET /psp/paymentorders/b80be381-b572-4f1e-9691-08d5dd095bc4 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <MerchantToken>
```

The (abbreviated) response containing an `updateorder`, `capture`,
`cancellation`, and `reversal` operation should look similar to the response
below:

| **Property**       | **Type**     | **Description**               |
| `paymentorder` | `object` | The payment order object.                                                          |

| `operations`   | `array`  | The array of possible operations to perform, given the state of the payment order. |

## Update Order

Change amount and vat amount on a payment order. If you implement `updateorder`
**you need to `refresh()`** the [Payment Menu front end][payment-menu-front-end]
so the new amount is shown to the end customer.

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```http
PATCH /psp/paymentorders/b80be381-b572-4f1e-9691-08d5dd095bc4 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <MerchantToken>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "paymentorder": {
        "operation": "UpdateOrder",
        "amount": 2500,
        "vatAmount": 120
    }
}
```

**Response**

The response given when changing a payment order is equivalent to a `POST`
or `GET` request towards the `paymentorders` resource,
[as displayed above][payment-menu-back-end]. Remember to call `.refresh()`
on the Payment Menu in JavaScript after updating the Payment Order.

## Capture

Capture can only be done on a payment with a successful authorized transaction.
It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount
than the authorized amount. You can later do more captures on the same payment
up to the total authorization amount.

**Notice** that the `orderItems`property object is optional. If the `POST` request has `orderItems` in the `paymentorder`, remember to include `orderItems` in the `capture` operation.
If the `paymentorder` is without `orderItems`, remember to leave this out in the `capture` operation.

To capture the authorized payment, we need to perform
`create-paymentorder-capture` against the accompanying href returned in the
`operations` list. See the abbreviated request and response below:

**Et voilà!** Checkout should now be complete, the payment should be secure and
everyone should be happy. But, sometimes you also need to implement the
cancellation and reversal operations described below.

## Cancel

If we want to cancel up to the total authorized (not captured) amount, we need
to perform `create-paymentorder-cancel` against the accompanying href returned
in the `operations` list. See the abbreviated request and response below:

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```http
POST /psp/paymentorders/b80be381-b572-4f1e-9691-08d5dd095bc4/cancellations HTTP/1.1
Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com
Authorization: Bearer <MerchantToken>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "transaction": {
        "payeeReference": "ABC123",
        "description": "Cancelling parts of the total amount"
    }
}
```

| ✔︎︎︎︎︎ | └➔&nbsp;`payeeReference` | `string(30)` | A unique reference from the merchant system. It is set per operation to ensure an exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation. See [payeeReference][payee-reference] for details. |
