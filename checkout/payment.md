## Checkin

As mentioned, Swedbank Pay Checkout consists of two parts: **Checkin** and
**Payment Menu**. In the sections that follow you'll find examples of the
HTTP requests, responses and HTML code you will need to implement in order to
complete the Swedbank Pay Checkout integration. Before Checkout you have to
Checkin. Obviously! To check in, the payer needs to be identified.

### Checkin Back End

The payer will be identified with the `consumers` resource and will be
persisted to streamline future Payment Menu processes. Payer identification
is done through the `initiate-consumer-session` operation. In the request body,
most properties are optional. However, the more information that is provided,
the easier the identification process becomes for the payer.
[See the technical reference for details][initiate-consumer-session].

|   | `msisdn`              | `string` | The [MSISDN][msisdn] (mobile phone number) of the payer. Format Sweden: `+46707777777`. Format Norway: `+4799999999`.
|   | `email`               | `string` | The e-mail address of the payer.

|   | └➔ `countryCode`          | `string` | The country code, denoting the origin of the issued social security number. Required if `nationalIdentifier.socialSecurityNumber` is set.

When the request has been sent, a response containing an array of operations that can be acted upon will be returned.

**Response**

```

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Property**             | **Type**     |  **Description** |
| `token`              | `string` | A session token used to initiate Checkout UI.
| `operations`         | `array`  | The array of operation objects to choose from, described in detail in the table below.
| └➔&nbsp;`rel`             | `string`     | The relational name of the operation, used as a programmatic identifier to find the correct operation given the current state of the application.
| └➔&nbsp;`method`             | `string`     | The HTTP method to use when performing the operation.
| └➔&nbsp;`contentType`             | `string`     | The HTTP content type of the target URI. Indicates what sort of resource is to be found at the URI, how it is expected to be used and behave.
| └➔&nbsp;`href`             | `string`     | The target URI of the operation.

### Checkin Front End

The response from the `POST` of consumer information contains a few operations.
The combination of `rel`, `method` and `contentType` should give you a clue how
the operation should be performed. The `view-consumer-identification` operation
and its `application/javascript` content type gives us a clue that the
operation is meant to be embedded in a `<script>` element in an HTML document.
[See the technical reference for details][view-consumer-identification].

        <script language="javascript">
            payex.hostedView.consumer({
                container: "checkin",
                onConsumerIdentified: function(consumerIdentifiedEvent) {
                    // consumerIdentifiedEvent.consumerProfileRef contains the reference
                    // to the identified consumer which we need to pass on to the
                    // Payment Order to initialize a personalized Payment Menu.
                    console.log(consumerIdentifiedEvent);
                },
                onShippingDetailsAvailable: function(shippingDetailsAvailableEvent) {
                    console.log(shippingDetailsAvailableEvent);
                }
            }).open();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Note that the `<script>` element is added after the `<div>` container the
Checkin will be hosted in. When this is set up, something along the
following should appear:

{:.text-center}
![Consumer UI][checkin-image]{:width="564" height="293"}

As you can see, the payer's information is pre-filled as provided by the
initial `POST`. When the payer completes the checkin, the events
`onConsumerIdentified` and `onShippingDetailsAvailable` will be raised with
the following argument objects:

{:.code-header}
**Consumer Identified Event Argument Object**

```JS
{
    "actionType": "OnConsumerIdentified",
    "consumerProfileRef": "7d5788219e5bc43350e75ac633e0480ab30ad20f96797a12b96e54da869714c4"
}
```

{:.code-header}
**Shipping Details Available Event Argument Object**

```JS
{
    "actionType": "OnShippingDetailsAvailable",
    "url": "https://api.externalintegration.payex.com/psp/consumers/<consumerProfileRef>/shipping-details"
}
```

With a `consumerProfileRef` safely tucked into our pocket, the Checkin is
complete and we can move on to checkout.

## Payment Menu

Payment Menu begins where checkin left off, in much the same way that the
checkin process progressed.

### Payment Menu Back End

We start by performing a `POST` request towards the `paymentorder` resource
with the `consumerProfileRef` we obtained in the checkin process described
above.

**Notice** that the `orderItems` property object is optional. If the `POST`
request has `orderItems` in the `paymentorder`, remember to include
`orderItems` in the [capture operation][capture-operation].

| **Property**       | **Type**     |  **Description** |
| `paymentorder` | `object` | The payment order object.|
| └➔&nbsp;`id`   | `string` | The relative URI to the payment order.|
| `operations`   | `array`  | The array of possible operations to perform, given the state of the payment order.

The `paymentorder` object is abbreviated since it's just the `id` and
`operations` we are interested in. Store the `id` of the Payment Order
in your system to look up status on the completed payment later.

Then find the `view-paymentorder` operation and embed its `href` a `<script>`.
That script will then load the hosted view for the Payment Menu. We will look
into how to hook that up next.

### Payment Menu Front End

To load the payment menu from the JavaScript URL obtained in the back end API
response, it needs to be set as a `script` element's `src` attribute. You can
cause a page reload and do this with static HTML or you can avoid the page
refresh by invoking the POST to create the payment order through Ajax and then
create the script element with JavaScript, all inside the event handler for
`onConsumerIdentified`.
[See the technical reference for details][consumer-events].

                }).open();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

This should bring up the Payment Menu in a hosted view, looking something like this:

{:.text-center}
![Payment Menu][payment-menu-image]{:width="556" height="798"}

When the consumer completes the payment, the Payment Menu script will be
signaled and a full redirect to the `completeUrl` sent in with the
Payment Order will be performed. When the `completeUrl` on your server is hit,
you can inspect the status on the stored `paymentorder.id` on the server, and
perform capture – unless the goods are sent physically to the payer; then you
should await capture until after the goods have been sent.

You may open and close the payment menu using `.open()` and `.close()`
functions. You can also invoke `.refresh()` to
[update the Payment Menu][payment-order-operations] after any changes to the
order.

## Payment Orders

The `paymentorders` resource is used when initiating a payment process through [Payment Menu][payment-menu] and [PayEx Checkout](/checkout/index). The payment order is a container for the payment method object selected by the payer. This will generate a payment that is accessed through the sub-resources `payments` and `currentPayment`.
