## Purchase Payment Orders

The `Purchase` operation is used in all common purchase scenarios.

{:.code-header}
**Purchase**

```js
{
    "paymentorder": {
        "operation": "Purchase"
    {
}
```

## Verify Payment Orders

The `Verify` operation lets you post verifications to confirm the validity of
**credit card information**, without reserving or charging any amount. This
option is mainly used to initiate a recurring payment scenario where the card
will be charged at a later date. The request body is equivalent to a `Purchase`
order with credit card as the selected item.
A [payment token][payment-orders-resource] will be generated automatically,
rendering the parameter `generateRecurrenceToken` unnecessary for this
operation.

{:.code-header}
**Verify**

```js
{
    "paymentorder": {
        "operation": "Verify"
    {
}
```

## Recurring Payments

If you want to enable subsequent recurring – server-to-server – payments for
credit card, you need to create a recurrence token. This token will be utilized
after the initial payment order.

**Recurrence Token**

* When initiating a `Purchase` payment order, you need to make sure that the
  attribute `generateRecurrenceToken` is set to `true`. This recurrence token
  will stored in the[authorization transaction][authorization-transaction] 
  sub-resource on the underlying credit card payment resource.
* When initiating a `Verify` payment order, a recurrence token will be generated
  automatically. This recurrence token is stored in the
  [verification][verification-transaction]  sub-resource on the underlying
  credit card payment resource.

You can view the current payment resource, containg the recurrence token and
other payment instrument properties, by [expanding the sub-resource][expanding] 
[`currentpayment`][current-payment] when doing a `GET` request on the
`paymentorders` resource.

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```http
GET /psp/paymentorders/<paymentorderId>?$expand=currentpayment HTTP/1.1
Host: api.payex.com
```

### Creating recurring credit card payments

When you have a `recurrenceToken` token safely tucked away, you can use this
token in a subsequent `Recur` payment order. This will be a server-to-server
affair, as we have tied all necessary payment instrument details related to the
recurrence token during the initial payment order.

#### Disable payment menu when only one instrument exist

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```js
{
    "paymentorder": {

    {
}

##### example disablePaymentMenu = false

![example disablePaymentMenu = false][image_enabled_payment_menu]{:width="464" :height="607"}

## Sub-resources

The `paymentOrders` resource utilize several sub-resources, relating to
underlying [payments][payment-orders-resource-payments],
[the current payment active][current-payment],
[payers][payment-orders-resource-payers] and [URLs][payment-resource-urls].
Common sub-resources like [payeeinfo][payment-resource-payeeinfo], that are
structurally identical for both payments and payments orders, are described in
the [Payment Resources][payment-resource] section.

### Payments Resource

A payment order is able to hold more than one payment object,
_even though a successful payment order only harbour one successful payment_.
This is necessary as the consumer might select and initate a payment option that
is not followed through successfully. I.e. if the consumer cancels an invoice
payment, a cancel transaction will still be tied to that particular invoice
payment resource. This payment resource will continue to exist, even if the
consumer successfully should finish the purchase with a credit card payment instead.

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as
described here in the documentation. Always use the `href` and `method` as
specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its
`rel` value. The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value
of the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request
for the given operation.

### View Payment Order

The `view-paymentorder` operation contains the URI of the JavaScript that needs to be set as a `script` element's `src` attribute, either client-side through JavaScript or server-side in HTML as shown below.

### Update Order

Change amount and vat amount on a payment order. If you implement `updateorder` **you need to `refresh()`** the [Payment Menu front end][payment-menu] so the new amount is shown to the end customer.

}
```

The response given when changing a payment order is equivalent to a `GET`
request towards the `paymentorders` resource, [as displayed above][payment-orders-resource].
Remember to call .refresh() on the Payment Menu in JavaScript

### Capture

Capture can only be done on a payment with a successful authorized transaction.
It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount.
You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount.

To capture the authorized payment, we need to perform
`create-paymentorder-capture` against the accompanying href returned in the
`operations` list. See the abbreviated request and response below:

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Required** | **Property** | **Type** | **Description**
| ✔︎ | transaction.description | `string` | The description of the capture transaction.
| ✔︎ | transaction.amount | `integer` | The amount including VAT in the lowest monetary unit of the currency. E.g. `10000` equals `100.00 NOK` and `5000` equals `50.00 NOK`.
| ✔︎ | transaction.vatAmount | `integer` | The amount of VAT in the lowest monetary unit of the currency. E.g. `10000` equals `100.00 NOK` and `5000` equals `50.00 NOK`.
| ✔︎ | transaction.payeeReference | string(30) | A unique reference from the merchant system. It is set per operation to ensure an exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation. See [payeeReference][payee-reference] for details.
| | transaction.orderItems | array | The array of items being purchased with the order. Used to print on invoices if the payer chooses to pay with invoice, among other things. [See Order Items for details][order-items].

If the capture succeeds, it should respond with something like the following:

```

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Property** | **Data Type** | **Description**
| payment | `string` | The relative URI of the payment this capture transaction belongs to.
| capture.id | `string` | The relative URI of the created capture transaction.
| capture.transaction | object | The object representation of the generic [`transaction resource`][authorization-transaction].

Checkout should now be complete, the payment should be secure and everyone should be happy. But, sometimes you also need to implement the cancellation and reversal operations described below.

### Abort

To abort a payment order, perform the `update-paymentorder-abort``` operation that is returned in the payment order response. You need to include the following HTTP body:

}
```

The response given when aborting a payment order is equivalent to a `GET` request towards the `paymentorders` resource, [as displayed above][payment-orders], with its `state` set to `Aborted`.

### Cancel

If we want to cancel up to the total authorized (not captured) amount, we need to perform `create-paymentorder-cancel` against the accompanying `href` returned in the `operations` list. See the abbreviated request and response below:

{:.code-header}
**Request**

## PayeeReference

The `payeeReference` given when creating transactions and payments has some specific processing rules depending on specifications in the contract.

* It must be unique for every operation, used to ensure exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation from the merchant system.
* Its length and content validation is dependent on whether the transaction.number or the `payeeReference` is sent to the acquirer.
  * If you select Option A in the settlement process (PayEx will handle the settlement), PayEx will send the transaction.number to the acquirer and the `payeeReference` may have the format of string(30).
  * If you select Option B in the settlement process (you will handle the settlement yourself), PayEx will send the `payeeReference` to the acquirer and it will be limited to the format of string(12) and all characters must be digits.

### Authorizations

The `authorizations` resource contains information about authorization transactions made on a specific payment.

#### Create authorization transaction

The `direct-authorization` operation creates an authorization transaction directly whilst the `redirect-authorization` operation redirects the consumer to PayEx Payment pages where the payment is authorized.

> **Note:** In order to use the `direct-authorization` operation, the servers and application involved in retrieving and transferring the credit card number from the payer to PayEx needs to be [PCI DSS][pci-dss] certified.**

**Response**

The [`authorization`][authorization-transaction] resource contains information about an authorization transaction made towards a payment, as previously described.

## Callback

The Callback  functionality is similar for all payment methods.

* Setting a `callbackUrl` in the HTTP `POST` API is optional, but highly recommended. If a payer closes the browser window, a network error or something else happens that prevents the payer from being redirect from PayEx back to the merchant website, the callback is what ensures that you receive information about what happened with the payment.
* When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or transaction, PayEx will perform a callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update.
* PayEx will make an HTTP `POST` to the `callbackUrl` that was specified when the payee (merchant) created the payment.
* When the `callbackUrl` receives such a callback, an HTTP `GET``` request must be made on the payment or on the transaction. The retrieved payment or transaction resource will give you the necessary information about the recent change/update.
* The callback will be retried if it fails. Below are the retry timings, in milliseconds from the initial transaction time:
  * 30000 ms
  * 60000 ms
  * 360000 ms
  * 432000 ms
  * 864000 ms
  * 1265464 ms
* The callback is sent from the following IP addresses: `82.115.146.1`

## Problems

When performing operations against the API, it will respond with a problem message that contain details of the error type if the request could not be successfully performed. Regardless of why the error occurred, the problem message will follow the same structure as specified in the [Problem Details for HTTP APIs][http-api-problems]] specification.

The structure of a problem message will look like this:

```js

| `status` | `integer` | The HTTP status code that the problem was served with.
| `action` | `string` | The `action` indicates how the error can be recovered from.
| `problems` | `array` | The array of problem detail objects.
| └➔&nbsp;`[].name` | `string` | The name of the property, header, object, entity or likewise that was erroneous.
| └➔&nbsp;`[].description` | `string` | The description of what was wrong with the property, header, object, entity or likewise identified by `name`.

### Common Problems

All common problem types will have a URI in the format `https://api.payex.com/psp/<error-type>`. The **URI is an identifier** and is currently not possible to dereference, although that might be possible in the future.

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Type** | **Status** | **Notes**
| `inputerror` |400|The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g. malformed request syntax, size to large, invalid request).
| `forbidden` |403|The request was valid, but the server is refusing the action. The necessary permissions to access the resource might be lacking.
| `notfound` |404|The requested resource could not be found, but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests are permissible.
| `systemerror` |500|A generic error message.
| `configurationerror` |500|A error relating to configuration issues.

### Payment Instrument Specific Problems

Problem types for a specific payment instrument will have a URI in the format `https://api.payex.com/psp/<payment-instrument>/<error-type>`. You can read more about the payment instrument specific problem messages below:

* [Card Payments][card-payments-problems]
* [**Invoice**][invoice-payments-problems]
* [**Swish**][swish-payments-problems]
* [**Vipps**][vipps-payments-problems]

### Expansion

The payment resource contain the ID of related sub-resources in its response properties. These sub-resources can be expanded inline by using the request parameter `expand`. This is an effective way to limit the number of necessary calls to the API, as you return several properties related to a Payment resource in a single request.

Note that the `expand` parameter is available to all API requests but only applies to the request response. This means that you can use the expand parameter on a `POST`  or `PATCH`request to get a response containing the target resource including expanded properties.

This example below add the `urls` and `authorizations` property inlines to the response, enabling you to access information from these sub-resources.

**Expansion**

```http
GET /psp/creditcard/payments/5adc265f-f87f-4313-577e-08d3dca1a26c?$expand=urls,authorizations HTTP/1.1
Host: api.payex.com
```

To avoid unnecessary overhead, you should only expand the nodes you need info about.
