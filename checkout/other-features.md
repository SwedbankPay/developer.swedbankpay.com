## Payment order

#### Purchase Payment Orders

The `Purchase` operation is used in all common purchase scenarios. 

{:.code-header}
**Purchase**
```js
{    
    "paymentorder": {
        "operation": "Purchase"
    {
}
```

#### Verify Payment Orders

The `Verify` operation lets you post verifications to confirm the validity of **credit card information**, without reserving or charging any amount. This option is mainly used to initiate a recurring payment scenario where the card will be charged at a later date. The request body is equivalent to a `Purchase` order with credit card as the selected item. A [payment token][payment-orders-resource] will be generated automatically, rendering the parameter `generateRecurrenceToken` unnecessary for this operation. 

{:.code-header}
**Verify**

```js
{    
    "paymentorder": {
        "operation": "Verify"
    {
}
```

#### Enabling recurring credit card payments

If you want to enable subsequent recurring - server-to-server - payments for credit card, you need to create a recurrence token. This token will be utilized after the initial payment order.  


**Recurrence Token**

* When initiating a `Purchase` payment order, you need to make sure that the attribute `generateRecurrenceToken` is set to `true`. This recurrence token will stored in the[ authorization transaction][authorization-transaction] sub-resource on the underlying credit card payment resource.
* When initiating a `Verify` payment order, a recurrence token will be generated automatically. This recurrence token is stored in the [verification][verification-transaction]  sub-resource on the underlying credit card payment resource.

You can view the current payment resource, containg the recurrence token and other payment instrument properties, by [expanding][expanding the sub-resource [`currentpayment`][current-payment] when doing a `GET` `request` on the `paymentorders`resource.

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```http
GET /psp/paymentorders/<paymentorderId>?$expand=currentpayment HTTP/1.1
Host: api.payex.com
```

#### Creating recurring credit card payments

When you have a `recurrenceToken` token safely tucked away, you can use this token in a subsequent `Recur` payment order. This will be a server-to-server affair, as we have tied all necessary payment instrument details related to the recurrence token during the initial payment order.

## Sub-resources

The `paymentOrders` resource utilize several sub-resources, relating to underlying [payments][payment-orders-resource-payments], [the current payment active][current-payment], [payers][payment-orders-resource-payers] and [URLs][payment-resource-urls].  
Common sub-resources like [payeeinfo][payment-resource-payeeinfo], that are structurally identical for both payments and payments orders, are described in the [Payment Resources][payment-resource] section. 

### Payments Resource

A payment order is able to hold more than one payment object, _even though a successful payment order only harbour one successful payment_. This is necessary as the consumer might select and initate a payment option that is not followed through successfully. I.e. if the consumer cancels an invoice payment, a cancel transaction will still be tied to that particular invoice payment resource. This payment resource will continue to exist, even if the consumer successfully should finish the purchase with a credit card payment instead.

## Operations

When a payment order resource is created and during its lifetime, it will have a set of operations that can be performed on it. The state of the payment order resource, what the access token is authorized to do, the chosen payment instrument and its transactional states, etc. determine the available operations before the initial purchase. A list of possible operations and their explanation is given below.

```

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Property** | **Description**
| href | The target URI to perform the operation against.
| rel | The name of the relation the operation has to the current resource.
| method | The HTTP method to use when performing the operation.
| contentType | The HTTP content type of the resource referenced in the `href` property.

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as described here in the documentation. Always use the `href` and `method` as specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its `rel` value. The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request for the given operation.

**Operations**

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Operation** | **Description**
| update-paymentorder-abort | [Aborts][abort] the payment order before any financial transactions are performed.
| update-paymentorder-updateorder | [Updates the order][update-order] with a change in the `amount` and/or `vatAmount`.
| redirect-paymentorder | Contains the URI that is used to redirect the consumer to the PayEx Payment Pages containing the Payment Menu.
| view-paymentorder | Contains the JavaScript `href` that is used to embed the Payment Menu UI directly on the webshop/merchant site.
| create-paymentorder-capture | The second part of a two-phase transaction where the authorized amount is sent from the payer to the payee. It is possible to do a part-capture on a subset of the authorized amount. Several captures on the same payment are possible, up to the total authorization amount.
| create-paymentorder-cancellation | Used to cancel authorized and not yet captured transactions. If a cancellation is performed after doing a part-capture, it will only affect the not yet captured authorization amount.
| create-paymentorder-reversal | Used to reverse a payment. It is only possible to reverse a payment that has been captured and not yet reversed.

### View Payment Order

The `view-paymentorder` operation contains the URI of the JavaScript that needs to be set as a `script` element's `src` attribute, either client-side through JavaScript or server-side in HTML as shown below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

                },
            }).open();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Update Order

Change amount and vat amount on a payment order. If you implement `updateorder` **you need to `refresh()`** the [Payment Menu front end][payment-menu] so the new amount is shown to the end customer.

}
```

The response given when changing a payment order is equivalent to a `GET` 
request towards the `paymentorders` resource, [as displayed above][payment-orders-resource]. 
Remember to call .refresh() on the Payment Menu in JavaScript

### Capture

Capture can only be done on a payment with a successful authorized transaction. 
It is possible to do a part-capture where you only capture a smaller amount than the authorized amount. 
You can later do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount.

To capture the authorized payment, we need to perform 
`create-paymentorder-capture` against the accompanying href returned in the 
`operations` list. See the abbreviated request and response below:

                "vatAmount": 125
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Property** | **Type** | **Required** | **Description**
| transaction.description | string | Y | The description of the capture transaction.
| transaction.amount | integer | Y | The amount including VAT in the lowest monetary unit of the currency. E.g. `10000` equals `100.00 NOK` and `5000` equals `50.00 NOK`.
| transaction.vatAmount | integer | Y | The amount of VAT in the lowest monetary unit of the currency. E.g. `10000` equals `100.00 NOK` and `5000` equals `50.00 NOK`.
| transaction.payeeReference | string(30) | Y | A unique reference from the merchant system. It is set per operation to ensure an exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation. See [payeeReference][payee-reference] for details.
| transaction.orderItems | array | N | The array of items being purchased with the order. Used to print on invoices if the payer chooses to pay with invoice, among other things. [See Order Items for details][order-items].

If the capture succeeds, it should respond with something like the following:

            "payeeReference": "AB832",
        }
    }
}
```

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Property** | **Data Type** | **Description**
| payment | string | The relative URI of the payment this capture transaction belongs to.
| capture.id | string | The relative URI of the created capture transaction.
| capture.transaction | object | The object representation of the generic [`transaction resource`][authorization-transaction].

Checkout should now be complete, the payment should be secure and everyone should be happy. But, sometimes you also need to implement the cancellation and reversal operations described below.

### Abort

To abort a payment order, perform the `update-paymentorder-abort``` operation that is returned in the payment order response. You need to include the following HTTP body:

            "contentType": "application/javascript"

```

The response given when aborting a payment order is equivalent to a `GET` request towards the `paymentorders` resource, [as displayed above][payment-orders], with its `state` set to `Aborted`.

### Cancel

If we want to cancel up to the total authorized (not captured) amount, we need to perform `create-paymentorder-cancel` against the accompanying `href` returned in the `operations` list. See the abbreviated request and response below:

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```http

Content-Type: application/json

{
    "transaction": {
        "payeeReference": "ABC123",
        "description": "Cancelling parts of the total amount"
    }
}
```

{:.code-header}
**Request Properties**

{:.table .table-striped}

#### Reversal

If we want to reverse a previously captured amount, we need to perform 
`create-paymentorder-reversal` against the accompanying href returned 
in the `operations` list. 
See the abbreviated request and response below:

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```http
POST /psp/paymentorders/b80be381-b572-4f1e-9691-08d5dd095bc4/reversals HTTP/1.1
Host: api.externalintegration.payex.com
Authorization: Bearer <MerchantToken>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "transaction": {
        "amount": 15610,
        "vatAmount": 3122,
        "payeeReference": "ABC123",
        "description": "description for transaction"
    }
}
```

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Property** | **Type** | **Required** | **Description**
| transaction.amount | integer | Y | The amount including VAT in the lowest monetary unit of the currency. E.g. `10000` equals `100.00 NOK` and `5000` equals `50.00 NOK`.
| transaction.vatAmount | integer | Y | The amount of VAT in the lowest monetary unit of the currency. E.g. `10000` equals `100.00 NOK` and `5000` equals `50.00 NOK`.
| transaction.payeeReference | string(30) | Y | A unique reference from the merchant system. It is set per operation to ensure an exactly-once delivery of a transactional operation. See [payeeReference][payee-reference for details.
| transaction.description | string | Y | Textual description of why the transaction is reversed.

If the reversal request succeeds, the response should be similar to the example below:
