## Payment Orders

{% include payment-order-get.md show_status_operations=true %}

### Creating a payment order

To create a payment order, you perform a `POST` request towards the
`paymentorders` resource:

{% include payment-order-purchase.md %}

#### Response

The response given when creating a payment order is equivalent to a `GET`
request towards the `paymentorders` resource, [as displayed above](#payment-orders)

### URLs

When creating a Payment Order, the `urls` field of the `paymentOrder`
contains the related URIs, including where the consumer gets redirected when
going forward with or cancelling a payment session, as well as the callback URI
that is used to inform the payee (merchant) of changes or updates made to
underlying payments or transaction.

The `paymentOrders` resource utilize several sub-resources, relating to
underlying [payments][payment-orders-resource-payments],
[the current payment active][current-payment],
[payers][payment-orders-resource-payers] and [URLs][payment-resource-urls].
Common sub-resources like [payeeinfo][payment-resource-payeeinfo], that are
structurally identical for both payments and payments orders, are described in
the [Payment Resources][payment-resource] section.

## Operations

When a payment order resource is created and during its lifetime, it will have
a set of operations that can be performed on it.
The state of the payment order resource, what the access token is authorized
to do, the chosen payment instrument and its transactional states, etc.
determine the available operations before the initial purchase.
A list of possible operations and their explanation is given below.

| :------------ | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `href`        | `string` | The target URI to perform the operation against.                                   |
| `rel`         | `string` | The name of the relation the operation has to the current resource.                |

| `contentType` | `string` | The HTTP content type of the resource referenced in the `href` field.              |

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as
described here in the documentation. Always use the `href` and `method` as
specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its
`rel` value. The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value
of the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request
for the given operation.

### Abort

To abort a payment order, perform the `update-paymentorder-abort` operation that
is returned in the payment order response. You need to include the following

The response given when aborting a payment order is equivalent to a `GET`
request towards the `paymentorders` resource,
[as displayed above][payment-orders],
with its `state` set to `Aborted`.

## Recurring Payments

If you want to enable subsequent recurring – server-to-server – payments, you
need to create a **recurrence token**. This token will be utilized after the
initial payment order. **Recurring payments must be activated on the contract
with Swedbank Pay in order to work.**

### Recurrence Token

* When initiating a `Purchase` payment order, you need to make sure that the
  field `generateRecurrenceToken` is set to `true`. This recurrence token
  will stored in the [authorization transaction][transaction]
  sub-resource on the underlying payment resource.
* When initiating a `Verify` payment order, a recurrence token will be generated
  automatically. This recurrence token is stored in the
  [verification][verification-transaction]  sub-resource on the underlying
  payment resource.

You can view the current payment resource, containg the recurrence token and
other payment instrument properties, by [expanding the sub-resource][expanding]
[`currentpayment`][current-payment] when doing a `GET` request on the
`paymentorders` resource.

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```http
GET /psp/paymentorders/{{ page.payment_order_id }}?$expand=currentpayment HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ page.api_host }}
```

### Creating Recurring Payments

When you have a `recurrenceToken` token safely tucked away, you can use this
token in a subsequent `Recur` payment order. This will be a server-to-server
affair, as we have tied all necessary payment instrument details related to the
recurrence token during the initial payment order.

## Purchase Payments

The `Purchase` operation is used in all common purchase scenarios.

{:.code-header}
**Purchase**

```js
{
    "paymentorder": {
        "operation": "Purchase"
    {
}
```

## Verify Payments

The `Verify` operation lets you post verifications to confirm the validity of
**credit card information**, without reserving or charging any amount. This
option is mainly used to initiate a recurring payment scenario where the card
will be charged at a later date. The request body is equivalent to a `Purchase`
order with credit card as the selected item.
A [recurrence token][payment-orders-resource] will be generated automatically,
rendering the parameter `generateRecurrenceToken` unnecessary for this
operation.

{:.code-header}
**Verify**

```js
{
    "paymentorder": {
        "operation": "Verify"
    {
}
```

## Payments Resource

A payment order is able to hold more than one payment object, _even though a
successful payment order only harbour one successful payment_. This is necessary
as the consumer might select and initiate a payment option that is not followed
through successfully. I.e. if the consumer cancels an invoice payment, a cancel
transaction will still be tied to that particular invoice payment resource. This
payment resource will continue to exist, even if the consumer successfully
should finish the purchase with a credit card payment instead.

## Checkin Events

The Checkin Seamless View can inform about events that occur during Checkin
through JavaScript event callbacks which can be implemented in the
`configuration` object passed to the `payex.hostedView.consumer(configuration)`
object.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Consumer
  participant Merchant
  participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay

  Consumer ->> Merchant: visit
  Merchant ->> Merchant: Prepare, Embed ClientScript
  Merchant ->> SwedbankPay: payex.hostedView.consumer().open()

  alt Configuration validation failure
    SwedbankPay -->> Merchant: onError
  end

  alt Identified consumer
      SwedbankPay->>Merchant: onConsumerIdentified

      alt Depending on backend response
        SwedbankPay->>Merchant: onShippingDetailsAvailable
        SwedbankPay->>Merchant: onBillingDetailsAvailable
      end
  end

  alt Change shipping address
    Consumer->>SwedbankPay: Click change shipping adress button
    SwedbankPay->>Merchant: OnShippingDetailsAvailable
  end
```

### `onConsumerIdentified`

This event triggers when a consumer has performed Checkin and is identified,
if the Payment Menu is not loaded and in the DOM.

The `onConsumerIdentified` event is raised with the following event argument
object:

{:.code-header}
**`onConsumerIdentified` event object**

```js
{
  "actionType": "OnConsumerIdentified",
  "consumerProfileRef": "{{ page.payment_token }}"
}
```

### `onShippingDetailsAvailable`

Triggered when a consumer has been identified or shipping address has been
updated.
{% include alert.html type="neutral" icon="info" body= "The Checkin must be
completed before any shipping details are finalized, as the Checkin component
provides shipping address via the `onShippingDetailsAvailable` event." %}

{:.code-header}
**`onShippingDetailsAvailable` event object**

```js
{
  "actionType": "OnBillingDetailsAvailable",
  "url": "/psp/consumers/{{ page.payment_token }}/shipping-details"
}
```

### `onBillingDetailsAvailable`

Triggered when a consumer has been identified

{:.code-header}
**`onBillingDetailsAvailable` event object**

```js
{
  "actionType": "OnBillingDetailsAvailable",
  "url":"/psp/consumers/{{ page.payment_token }}/billing-details"
}
```

### `onError`

Triggered on terminal errors, and when the configuration fails validation.

## Enable or Disable Payment Menu

It is possible to disable the payment menu when only one instrument exist by
setting the `disablePaymentMenu` field to `true`. The default value is
`false`, exemplified below.

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```js
{
    "paymentorder": {
        "disablePaymentMenu": false
    {
}
```

{:.text-center}
![example disablePaymentMenu = false][image_enabled_payment_menu]{:width="464" :height="607"}

Setting `disablePaymentMenu` field to `true` removes all other payment
instruments but the one that is available.
This feature is only valuable to set to `true` if you have only one payment
instrument available. By setting it to `true` will remove the frame around the
menu and show only the instrument.

{:.code-header}
**Request**

```js
{
    "paymentorder": {
        "disablePaymentMenu": true
    {
}
```

{:.text-center}
![example disablePaymentMenu = true][image_disabled_payment_menu]{:width="463" :height="553"}

## Callback

* Setting a `callbackUrl` in the HTTP `POST` API is optional, but highly
  recommended. If a payer closes the browser window, a network error or
  something else happens that prevents the payer from being redirect from
  Swedbank Pay back to the merchant website, the callback is what ensures that
  you receive information about what happened with the payment.
* When a change or update from the back-end system are made on a payment or
  transaction, Swedbank Pay will perform an asynchronous server-to-server
  callback to inform the payee (merchant) about this update.
* Swedbank Pay will make an HTTP `POST` to the `callbackUrl` that was
  specified when the payee (merchant) created the payment.
* When the `callbackUrl` receives such a callback, an HTTP `GET` request must
  be made on the payment or on the transaction.
  The retrieved payment or transaction resource will give you the necessary
  information about the recent change/update.
* The callback will be retried if it fails.
  Below are the retry timings, in seconds
  from the initial transaction time:
  * 30 seconds
  * 60 seconds
  * 360 seconds
  * 432 seconds
  * 864 seconds
  * 1265 seconds
* The callback is sent from the following IP address `82.115.146.1`.

## Problems

When performing operations against the API, it will respond with a problem
message that contain details of the error type if the request could not be
successfully performed.
Regardless of why the error occurred, the problem message will follow the same
structure as specified in the
[Problem Details for HTTP APIs][http-api-problems]] specification.

The structure of a problem message will look like this:

```js
{
    "type": "https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/inputerror",
    "title": "There was an input error",
    "detail": "Please correct the errors and retry the request",
    "instance": "{{ page.transaction_id }}",
    "status": 400,
    "action": "RetryNewData",
    "problems": [{
        "name": "CreditCardParameters.Issuer",
        "description": "minimum one issuer must be enabled "
    }]
}
```

### Common Problems

All common problem types will have a URI in the format
`https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/<payment-instrument>/<error-type>`.
The **URI is an identifier** and is currently not possible to dereference,
although that might be possible in the future.

{:.table .table-striped}

| :------------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inputerror`         | `400`  | The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g. malformed request syntax, size to large, invalid request). |
| `forbidden`          | `403`  | The request was valid, but the server is refusing the action. The necessary permissions to access the resource might be lacking.                   |
| `notfound`           | `404`  | The requested resource could not be found, but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests are permissible.                                |
| `systemerror`        | `500`  | A generic error message.                                                                                                                           |
| `configurationerror` | `500`  | A error relating to configuration issues.                                                                                                          |

## Updating Payment Menu

When the contents of the shopping cart changes or anything else that affects
the amount occurs, the `paymentorder` must be updated and the Payment Menu
must be `refresh`ed.

{% include alert.html type="neutral" icon="info" body= "Features that are not
described in the previous sections must not be used, although they are
available in the API. Flags that can be turned to `true` must be kept
`false` as described in this standard setup documentation." %}

resilient to change. Properties, operations, headers, etc., that aren't
understood in any response **must be ignored**. Don't expect a specific order of
elements. When in doubt, please follow the [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)." %}
