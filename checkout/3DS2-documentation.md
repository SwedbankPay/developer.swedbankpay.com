### Glossary

{:.table .table-striped}
| Term      | Description |
|:---       |:---        |
| Recurring (requires recurrenceToken) | Subscription type payment. E.g Monthly debited amount for service.
| Stored Card | Card data is saved on the consumers profile to allow future payments to be simplified.
| Verification Transaction (operation Verify) | Create a payment without debiting the consumer. Used to create a recurrenceToken for recurring payments without debiting an amount.

**API Changes for 3DS2.0 in PaymentOrder**

{:.table .table-striped}
| Change      | Description |
|:---       |:---        |
| Removed   | generatePaymentToken removed as stored card is handled by PayEx.
| Added     | generateRecurrenceToken added to create a token for recurring payments.
| Added     | Payer object and parameters added to allow decreased chance of authentication challenge flow.
| Removed   | Some CreditCard object-parameters removed as they will not be eligible in 3DS2.0. (E.g. no3DSecure: true).

## Use Cases: Create Payment Order
There are three different Create Payment Order cases based on which kind of integration you're set to use.

{:.table .table-striped}
| Integration      | Definition |
|:---              |:---        |
| PayEx Checkout   | The standard setup. The consumer provide details on PayEx end to create a new consumer profile or use an already existing profile of the consumer.
| PayEx Checkout without Checkin | Anonymous payment. No consumer profile will be created or used in the payment. Does not allow stored cards.
| PayEx Checkout - Merchant onboarding | The advanced setup. The merchant provides consumer details and PayEx will create a new consumer profile or use an already existing profile of the consumer. An advanced setup needs a separate GDPR agreement and approval from PayEx.

### 1.0 Use Case: PayEx Checkout

## 3.0 Use Case: Stored Card Payments
A payment order where the consumer stores their card during the payment. As you will notice, this scenario is the same as a regular payment. This is because the choice is on the consumers end to store their card data on their profile, this option will be available for the consumer inside the payment menu. If the consumer chooses to store their card data, the used card data will be shown (masked) and available to use in future payments.

If you allow consumers to store cards on their profile without making any purchase, use operation Verify.

### 3.2 Stored Card Payment Order
The card data is stored after the payment is completed and if the consumer chose to store their card. Go back to [3.1 Create Payment Order](#31-create-payment-order) and perform the same request when the consumer wants to make a new purchase but this time it will be in a simplified manner as their card is stored on their checkout profile. 

**Important!** Use Operation Purchase when creating a payment order that should debit the consumer as Verify will not debit any amount.

## 4.0 Use Case: Stored Card and Recurring Combination Payment
A payment order where you allow the consumer to store their card on their profile and you (the merchant) wants to create a recurrence token for recurring payments.

**Recurring payments**: Set generateRecurrenceToken value to **true** and a recurrenceToken will be available to retrieve after the completed payment.

**Stored Card**: The choice to store a card is on the consumers end, this option will be available for the consumer inside the payment menu. If the consumer chooses to store their card data, the card used will be shown (masked) and available to use in future payments after the completed payment.

**Create a recurring payment**

When you have a recurrence token safely tucked away, you can use this token in a subsequent Recur payment. This will be a server-to-server affair, as we have tied all necessary payment instrument details related to the recurrence token during the initial payment order.

### 4.3 Stored Card Payment Order
If the consumer chose to store their card in the previous payment order created in [4.1 Create Payment Order](#41-create-payment-order) you can create a new payment order and the consumers card will be presented in the payment menu.

**Important!** Use Operation Purchase when creating a payment order that should debit the consumer as Verify will not debit any amount.
Set generateRecurrenceToken value to **false** as you've already created a recurrenceToken for the consumer.

Example follows Create Payment Order [1.2 Use Case: PayEx Checkout - Merchant onboarding](#12-use-case-payex-checkout---merchant-onboarding)

## 5.0 Use Case: Multimerchant Stored Card and Recurring Combination Payment

**<u>THIS SCENARIO IS ONLY FOR MULTIMERCHANT CUSTOMERS</u>**  
In this scenario we will use 3 active merchants. Merchant One, Merchant Two and Merchant Three.  

A payment order where you allow the consumer to store their card on their profile that will be available for several merchants and you (the merchant) wants to create a recurrence token for recurring payments.  
  
**Recurring payments**: Set generateRecurrenceToken value to **true** and a recurrenceToken will be available to retrieve after the completed payment.  
**The recurrenceToken generated will only be available for the merchant whom generated it.**  

**Stored Card**: The choice to store a card is on the consumers end, this option will be available for the consumer inside the payment menu. If the consumer chooses to store their card data, the card used will be shown (masked) and available to use in future payments after the completed payment. The stored card will be available for the consumer on Merchant One, Merchant Two and Merchant Three.

**Create a recurring payment for Merchant One**  
When you have a recurrence token safely tucked away, you can use this token in a subsequent Recur payment. This will be a server-to-server affair, as we have tied all necessary payment instrument details related to the recurrence token during the initial payment order.

### 5.3 Stored Card Payment Order Merchant One

If the consumer chose to store their card in the previous payment order created in [5.1 Create Payment Order](#51-create-payment-order---merchant-one) you can create a new payment order and the consumers card will be presented in the payment menu.

**Important!** Use Operation Purchase when creating a payment order that should debit the consumer as Verify will not debit any amount.
Set generateRecurrenceToken value to **false** as you've already created a recurrenceToken for the consumer.

Example follows Create Payment Order [1.2 Use Case: PayEx Checkout - Merchant onboarding](#12-use-case-payex-checkout---merchant-onboarding)
