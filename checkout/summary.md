## Best Practices

A completed integration against Swedbank Pay Checkout should adhere to a set of
best practice criteria in order to successfully go through Swedbank Pay's
integration validation procedure.

### Must Haves

* The Checkin and Payment Menu components (the two `<iframe>` elements) must be
  separate (one must not replace the other).
* The Checkin must be completed before any shipping details are finalized, as
  the Checkin component provides shipping address via the
  `onShippingDetailsAvailable` event.
* A button in the webshop or merchant web site needs to exist that allows the
  user to not perform Checkin ("Shop anonymously"). See
  [guest payments][guest-payments] for details.
* If a browser refresh is performed after the payer has checked in, the payment
  menu must be shown even though `onConsumerIdentified` is not invoked.
* The `consumerProfileRef` returned in the response from the `POST` request to
  the `consumers` resource must be included in the `POST` request to the
  `paymentorders` resource.
* When the contents of the shopping cart changes or anything else that affects
  the amount occurs, the `paymentorder` must be updated and the Payment Menu
  must be `refresh`ed.
* Features not described on this page must not be used, although they are
  available in the API. Flags that can be turned to `true` must be kept
  `false` as described in this standard setup documentation.
* When the payer is checked in, he or she must be identified appropriately in
  the Payment Menu (stored credit cards must be visible for the credit card
  payment instrument, for instance).
* `orderReference` must be sent as a part of the `POST` request to
  `paymentorders` and must represent the order ID of the webshop or merchant
  website.
* The integration needs to handle both one and two phase purchases correctly.
* All of the operations `Cancel`, `Capture` and `Reversal` must be implemented.
* The [transaction callback][callback] must be handled appropriately.
* [Problems][problems] that may occur in Swedbank Pay' API must be handled
  appropriately.
* Your integration must be resilient to change. Properties, operations,
  headers, etc., that aren't understood in any response **must be ignored**.
  Failing due to a something occurring in a response that your implementation
  haven't seen before is a major malfunction of your integration and must be
  fixed.
