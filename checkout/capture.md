{% include payment-order-capture.md %}

**Et voilà!** Checkout should now be complete, the payment should be secure and
everyone should be happy. But, sometimes you also need to implement the
cancellation and reversal operations described below.

{% include iterator.html prev_href="payment-menu"
                         prev_title="Back: Payment Menu"
                         next_href="after-payment"
                         next_title="Next: After Payment" %}
