title: Checkout – Checkin
estimated_read: 30
description: |
  Swedbank Pay Checkout consists of two parts:
  **Checkin** and **Payment Menu**. In the sections that follow you'll find
  examples of the HTTP requests, responses and HTML code you will need to
  implement in order to complete the Swedbank Pay Checkout integration. To
  finalize Checkout you first have to Checkin. To check in, the payer needs
  to be identified.
---

## Step 1: Initiate session for consumer identification

The payer will be identified with the `consumers` resource and will be
persisted to streamline future Payment Menu processes. Payer identification
is done through the `initiate-consumer-session` operation.

{% include alert.html type="informative" icon="info" header="Guest Checkout"
body="Note: If the end user is using the Payment Menu as a guest, you can go
directly to step 3, which you will find on the next page." %}

When the request has been sent, a response containing an array of operations that can be acted upon will be returned:

## Step 2: Display Swedbank Pay Checkin module

The response from the `POST` of consumer information contains a few operations.
The combination of `rel`, `method` and `contentType` should give you a clue how
the operation should be performed.
The `view-consumer-identification` operation
and its `application/javascript` content type gives us a clue that the
operation is meant to be embedded in a `<script>` element in an HTML document.

{% include alert.html type="warning"
                    icon="warning"
                    header=""
                    body="In our example we will focus on using the
                    `view-consumer-identification` solution.
                    The `redirect-consumer-identification` method redirects
                    the user to Swedbank's own site to handle the checkin
                    and is used in other implementations.
                    `redirect-consumer-identification` **should only be used in
                    test enviroments**. It is not suitable for the production
                    environment as there is no simple way of retrieving the
                    `consumerProfileRef`."%}

{:.code-header}
**HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Swedbank Pay Checkout is Awesome!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="checkin"></div>
        <div id="payment-menu"></div>
        <!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file -->
        <script src="<Your-JavaScript-File-Here>"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

{% include alert.html type="informative" icon="info" body="The Checkin and Payment
Menu components (the two `<iframe>` elements) must be separate
(one must not replace the other)." %}

In the HTML, you only need to add two `<div>` elements to place the
check-in and payment menu inside of. The JavaScript will handle the rest when
it comes to handling the check-in and payment menu.

{:.code-header}
**JavaScript**

```js
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();

request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    // We will assume that our own backend returns the
    // exact same as what SwedbankPay returns.
    var response = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    // This assumes that the operations from the response of the POST from the
    // payment order is returned verbatim from the server to the Ajax:
    var operation = response.operations.find(function (o) {
        return o.rel === 'view-consumer-identification';
    });

    script.setAttribute('src', operation.href);
    script.onload = function () {
        payex.hostedView.consumer({
            // The container specifies which id the script will look for
            // to host the checkin component
            container: 'checkin',
            onConsumerIdentified: function onConsumerIdentified(consumerIdentifiedEvent) {
                // consumerIdentifiedEvent.consumerProfileRef contains the reference
                // to the identified consumer which we need to pass on to the
                // Payment Order to initialize a personalized Payment Menu.
                console.log(consumerIdentifiedEvent);
            },
            onShippingDetailsAvailable: function onShippingDetailsAvailable(shippingDetailsAvailableEvent) {
                console.log(shippingDetailsAvailableEvent);
            }
        }).open();
    };
    // Appending the script to the head
    var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
    head.appendChild(script);
});

// Place in your own API endpoint here.
request.open('POST', '<Your-Backend-Endpoint-Here>', true);
request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json; charset=utf-8');
// In this example we'll send in all of the information mentioned before,
// in the request to the endpoint.
request.send(JSON.stringify({
    operation: 'initiate-consumer-session',
    language: 'sv-SE',
    shippingAddressRestrictedToCountryCodes: ['NO', 'SE']
}));
```

{% include alert.html type="informative" icon="info" body="
Note that we add the script at the end of the body. This ensures that
every element (like the container `<div>` elements) has loaded in before we try to
access them with our script." %}

With the scripts loading in after the entire page is loaded, we can access the
`<div>` container that the Checkin will be hosted in.
After that has all loaded, you should see something like this:

{:.text-center}
![Consumer UI][checkin-image]{:width="475" height="250"}

As you can see, the payer's information is pre-filled as provided by the
initial `POST`. With a `consumerProfileRef` safely tucked into our pocket,
the Checkin is complete and we can move on to [Payment Menu][payment-menu].

A complete overview of how the process of identifying the payer through Checkin
is illustrated in the sequence diagram below.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Payer
    participant Merchant
    participant SwedbankPay as Swedbank Pay

        rect rgba(238, 112, 35, 0.05)
            note left of Payer: Checkin

    Payer ->>+ Merchant: Start Checkin
    Merchant ->>+ SwedbankPay: POST /psp/consumers
    deactivate Merchant
    SwedbankPay -->>+ Merchant: rel:view-consumer-identification ①
    deactivate SwedbankPay
    Merchant -->>- Payer: Show Checkin on Merchant Page

    Payer ->>+ Payer: Initiate Consumer Hosted View (open iframe) ②
    Payer ->>+ SwedbankPay: Show Consumer UI page in iframe ③
    deactivate Payer
    SwedbankPay ->>- Payer: Consumer identification process
    activate Payer
    Payer ->>+ SwedbankPay: Consumer identification process
    deactivate Payer
    SwedbankPay -->>- Payer: show consumer completed iframe
    activate Payer
    Payer ->> Payer: EVENT: onConsumerIdentified (consumerProfileRef) ④
    deactivate Payer
    end
```

If a browser refresh is performed after the payer has checked in, the payment
menu must be shown even though `onConsumerIdentified` is not invoked.

Additional events during Checkin  can also be implemented in the `configuration`
object, such as `onConsumerIdentified`, `onShippingDetailsAvailable`and
`onBillingDetailsAvailable`. Read more about these in the [Checkin
events][checkin-events] section.

### Note on consumer data

During this stage some consumer data is stored. Read more about our [Data
Protection Policy][data-protection] for details on which information we store
and its duration.
