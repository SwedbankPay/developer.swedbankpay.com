  Redirect is our simplest integration. The payer will be redirected to a secure
  Swedbank Pay hosted site, authenticate their Checkout profile and choose
  payment instrument. After the purchase, the payer will be redirected back to
  your website.

The **Authenticated Redirect** integration consists of three main steps.
**Creating** the payment order and checkin, **displaying** the payment menu and
checkin module, and finally **capturing** the funds. In addition, there are
other post purchase options you need. We get to them later on.

If you want to get an overview before proceeding, you can look at the [sequence
diagram][sequence-diagrams]. It is also available in the sidebar if you want to
look at it later. LetÂ´s get going with the two first steps of the integration.

## Step 1: Create Payment Order And Checkin

When the purchase is initiated, you need to create a payment order.

Start by performing a `POST` request towards the `paymentorder` resource
with payer information and a `completeUrl`.

A new field has been added to the payment order request in this integration.
This is called `productName` and is a part of the `payer` node. This field is
required if you want to use Checkout v3, as the needed operations won't be
available in the response if it's not included.

When `productName` is set to `checkout3`, `requireConsumerInfo` will have its
default value set to false. while `digitalProducts` will default to true.

Please note that `shippingAdress` is only required if `digitalProducts` is set
to `false`. `requireConsumerInfo` **must** be set to `false`.

Supported features for this integration are subscriptions (`recur` and
`unscheduled MIT`), split settlement (`subsite`) and the possibility to use your
own `logo`.

Sometimes you might need to abort purchases. An example could be if a payer does
not complete the purchase within a reasonable timeframe. For those instances we
have `abort`, which you can read about in the [core features][abort-feature].
You can only use `abort` if the payer **has not** completed an `authorize` or a
`sale`.

## Step 2: Display Payment Menu And Checkin

Among the operations in the POST `paymentOrders` response, you will find the
`redirect-checkout`. This is the one you need to display the checkin and
payment menu.

**Response**

```
{
    "paymentOrder": {
    "operations": [
        {
            "method": "GET",
            "href": "https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/payment/menu/b934d6f84a89a01852eea01190c2bbcc937ba29228ca7502df8592975ee3bb0d",
            "rel": "redirect-checkout",
            "contentType": "text/html"
        },
    ]
}
```

The redirect link opens the payment menu in checkin state. The first page will
be the checkin page where the payer provides their email and phone number.

A known payer will be sent directly to the payment menu shown further below. If
we detect that the payer is new, we give them the option to store their details
or proceed without storing. If that happens, these checkin steps will appear.

After choosing yes or no, the payer must enter their SSN.

With digital products, the payer will be sent directly to the payment menu after
selecting to store their details. For mixed goods, the SSN input view will
expand and the payer must enter their shipping address. Payers choosing not to
store credentials (guests) must also enter their shipping address.

![screenshot of the seamless view checkin when entering details][checkin-enter-details-mixed]

After checking in, the payment menu will appear on a new page with the payer
information displayed above the menu. The payer can select their preferred
payment instrument and pay. The example with shipping address is for all goods
(physical and digital), the one without shipping address is for digital
products only.

Once the payer has completed the purchase, you can perform a `GET` towards the
`paymentOrders` resource to see the purchase state.

You are now ready to `capture` the funds. Follow the link below to read more
about capture and the other options you have after the purchase.
