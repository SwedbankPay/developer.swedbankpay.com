  Redirect is our simplest integration. Swedbank Pay handles the purchase so you
  can focus on your core activities. When ready to pay, the payer will be
  redirected to a secure Swedbank Pay hosted site, authenticate their Checkout
  profile and choose payment instrument. After the purchase, the payer will be
  redirected back to your website.

## Step 1: Create Payment Order

When the purchase is initiated, you need to create a payment order.

Start by performing a `POST` request towards the `paymentorder` resource
with payer information and a `completeUrl`.

Two new fields have been added to the payment order request in this integration.
`requireConsumerInfo` and `digitalProducts`. They are a part of the `payer`
node. Please note that `shippingAdress` is only required if `digitalProducts` is
set to `false`. `requireConsumerInfo` **must** be set to `false`.

Supported features for this integration are subscriptions (`recur` and
`unscheduled MIT`), split settlement (`subsite`) and the possibility to use your
own `logo`.

Sometimes you might need to abort purchases. An example could be if a payer does
not complete the purchase within a reasonable timeframe. For those instances we
have `abort`, which you can read about in the [core features][abort-feature].
You can only use `abort` if the payer **has not** completed an `authorize` or a
`sale`.

{% include payment-order-checkout-mac.md integration_mode="redirect" %}

## Step 2: Display Payment Menu

Among the operations in the POST `paymentOrders` response, you will find the
`redirect-checkout`. This is the one you need to display payment menu.

{:.code-view-header}
**Response**

```
{
    "paymentOrder": {
    "operations": [
        {
            "method": "GET",
            "href": "https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/payment/menu/b934d6f84a89a01852eea01190c2bbcc937ba29228ca7502df8592975ee3bb0d",
            "rel": "redirect-checkout",
            "contentType": "text/html"
        },
    ]
}
```

The redirect link opens the payment menu on a new page with the payer
information displayed above the menu. The payer can select their preferred
payment instrument and pay. The example with shipping address is for all goods
(physical and digital), the one without shipping address is for digital
products only.

Once the payer has completed the purchase, you can perform a `GET` towards the
`paymentOrders` resource to see the purchase state.

You are now ready to capture the funds. Follow the link below to read more about
capture and the other options you have after the purchase.
