## Checkout

Swedbank Pay Checkout allows your customers to be identified by Swedbank Pay,
enabling existing Swedbank Pay Checkout users to pay with their favorite payment
methods in just a few simple steps.

## Prerequisites

To start integrating Swedbank Pay Checkout, you need the following:

*   [HTTPS][https] enabled web server.
*   Agreement that includes Swedbank Pay Checkout.
*   Obtained credentials (merchant Access Token) from Swedbank Pay through
    Swedbank Pay Admin.

## Introduction

To get started with Swedbank Pay Checkout v3, you should learn about its different
components and how they work together. Swedbank Pay Checkout consists of two
related concepts: **Checkin** and **Payment Menu**. Checkin
identifies the consumer in our Consumer API and Payment Menu authorizes the
payment with our Payment Menu API.

The next step is to **Capture** the payment. You can either capture the total
amount, or do a part-capture (as described under
[After Payment][after-payment-capture]). Connect these steps and you have
Swedbank Pay Checkout.

While Checkin is a necessary component to store personal information and access
features like storing cards, it is not a mandatory step for the Checkout process
to work. If the payer is from a country where we currently don't support
to create a consumer profile, or if he or she opts not to store their data, that's fine. The Payment
Menu can still be used as a **guest**.
