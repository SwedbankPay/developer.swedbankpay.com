# shipIndicator



[androidJvm]\




@SerializedName(value = "shipIndicator")



val [shipIndicator](ship-indicator.html): [String](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)?



Indicates the shipping method for this order.



Values are according to the [Swedbank Pay documentation](https://developer.swedbankpay.com/checkout/payment-menu#request). However, you should usually use the constructor that takes a [ShipIndicator](../-ship-indicator/index.html) argument, which models the different options in a Kotlin-native way.
