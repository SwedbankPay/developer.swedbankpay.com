## Options After Posting A Payment

When you detect that the payer has reached your `completeUrl`, you need to do a
`GET` request on the payment resource, which contains the `id` of the `payment`
generated in the first step, to receive the state of the transaction. You will
also be able to see the available `operations` after posting a payment.

*   **Abort:** It is possible to abort the process if the payment has no
  successful transactions. [See the `abort` description](#abort).
*   For reversals, you will need to implement the `reversal` request.
*   **If CallbackURL is set:** Whenever changes to the payment occur a[Callback
  request][callback-request] will be posted to the `callbackUrl`,which was set
  when the payment was created.

## Reversals

The `create-reversal` operation will reverse a payment and
refund the amount to the payer. To reverse a payment, perform the
`create-reversal` operation. The HTTP body of the request should look as
follows:

## Reversal Request

## Reversal Response

The `reversal` resource will be returned, containing information about the newly created reversal transaction.

{% include transaction-response.md transaction="reversal" %}

## List Reversal Transactions

The `reversals` resource will list the reversal transactions
(one or more) on a specific payment. The URL will be found on a `payment` that has a
successful `sale` operation.

{% capture request_header %}GET /psp/trustly/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/reversals HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ page.api_host }}
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
Content-Type: application/json{% endcapture %}

{% include code-example.html
    title='Request'
    header=request_header
    json= request_content
    %}

{% include transaction-list-response.md transaction="reversal" %}

## Reversal Sequence Diagram

`Reversal` can only be done on completed Sales transactions.
