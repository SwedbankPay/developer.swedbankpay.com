If you are a **new merchant** getting started with your implementation,
[Digital Payments][payments-only] is everything you need. The implementations in
this section are available so merchants already using them can access
documentation, but no new development or updates will be done here.

If you are an existing merchant already using the Checkout v2, Payment Menu v2
or Payment Methods v1, we recommend switching to
[Digital Payments][payments-only] for an even better payment experience. For
Checkout v2 and Payment Menu v2, we have a migration guide available for you.
For payment method integrations, the [Get Started section][get-started] is the
place to go.

Even though we rearranged our menu, the implementation sections remain the same,
and no documentation has been deleted. Follow the links below or in the sidebar
to find your section.
