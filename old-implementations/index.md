  A collection of our earlier implementation options.

If you are a **new merchant** getting started with your implementation,
[Checkout v3][payments-only] is everything you need. The implementations in this
section will be maintained, but our focus area going forward, where new features
are going to be added, is Checkout v3.

If you are an existing merchant already using the Checkout v2, Payment Menu v2
or Payment Instruments v1, we recommend switching to
[Checkout v3][payments-only] for an even better payment experience. A migration
guide is coming shortly.

Even though we rearranged our menu, the implementation sections remain the same,
and no documentation has been deleted. Follow the links below or in the sidebar
to find your section.

{% include iterator.html next_href="/old-implementations/payment-instruments-v1/"
                         next_title="Payment Instruments v1" %}
{% include iterator.html next_href="/old-implementations/payment-menu-v2/"
                         next_title="Payment Menu v2" %}
