If you are a **new merchant** getting started with your implementation,
[Digital Payments][payments-only] is everything you need. The implementations in
this section will be maintained, but our focus area going forward, where new
features are going to be added, is Digital Payments.

If you are an existing merchant already using the Checkout v2, Payment Menu v2
or Payment Methods v1, we recommend switching to
[Digital Payments][payments-only] for an even better payment experience. A
migration guide is coming shortly.

Even though we rearranged our menu, the implementation sections remain the same,
and no documentation has been deleted. Follow the links below or in the sidebar
to find your section.

                         next_title="Payment Menu v2" %}
