  How to create payments when using Digital Payments v3.1.

The integration consists of three main steps. **Creating** the payment order,
**displaying** the payment menu, and **capturing** the funds. In addition, there
are other post-purchase options you need. We get to them later on.

## Step 1: Create Payment Order

When your customer has initiated a purchase, you need to create a payment order.

Start by performing a `POST` request towards the `paymentorder` resource
with payer information and a `completeUrl`.

We have added `productName` to the payment order request in this integration.
You can find it in the `paymentorder` field. This is required if you want to use
Digital Payments. If it isnÂ´t included in your request, you won't get the
correct operations in the response.

When `productName` is set to `checkout3`, `digitalProducts` will be set to
`false` by default.

Supported features for this integration are subscriptions (`recur`, `one-click`
and `unscheduled MIT`), `MOTO`, instrument mode, split settlement (`subsite`)
and the possibility to use your own `logo`.

There is also a guest mode option for the payers who don't wish to store their
information. When using **Payments Only**, the way to trigger this is to not
include the `payerReference` field in your `paymentOrder` request. You can find
it in the `payer` field in the example below.

Sometimes you might need to abort purchases. An example could be if a payer does
not complete the purchase within a reasonable timeframe. For those instances we
have `abort`, which you can read about in the [core features][abort-feature].
You can only use `abort` if the payer **has not** completed an `authorize` or a
`sale`.

## Adding To Your Request

The request shown above includes what you need to create the payment, but you
can add more sections if you need or want.

Examples can be to include [order items][order-items] by adding a separate node,
or provide risk indicators and information about the payer to
[make the payment process as frictionless as possible][frictionless].

Read more about possible additions to the request in our
[feature section][features].
