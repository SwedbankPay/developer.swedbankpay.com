  Bare minimum implementation of the **Swedbank Pay Mobile SDK**
menu_order: 800
---

In this chapter we provide the bare minimum implementation needed to present the
Swedbank Pay UI using the Mobile SDK. There are several important limitations
with this implementation that we're listing at the end of the chapter.

## Payment

To start off, you need a payment to present. If you already have a backend
implementation of the Swedbank Pay APIs, you can use that to initialize a
payment order. If you don't have a backend implementation, you can manually
create a payment order using Swagger or a similar tool.

For simplicity, we're specifying some simple placeholder values and URLs when
creating the payment order that you can use as well. There is no need for the
bare minimum implementation to provide URLs to actual working sites:

```http
POST /psp/paymentorders HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ page.api_host }}
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
Content-Type: application/json;version=3.1

{
    "paymentorder": {
        "operation": "Purchase",
        "currency": "SEK",
        "amount": 1500,
        "vatAmount": 375,
        "description": "Test App Purchase",
        "userAgent": "SDK-Test",
        "language": "sv-SE",
        "urls": {
            "hostUrls": [ "https://example.com" ],
            "paymentUrl": "examplepayment://payment/",
            "completeUrl": "https://example.com/payment-completed",
            "cancelUrl": "https://example.com/payment-cancelled",
            "termsOfServiceUrl": "https://example.com/tos",
            "callbackUrl": "https://api.example.com/payment-callback"
        },
        "payeeInfo": {
            "payeeId": "{{ page.merchant_id }}",
            "payeeReference": "AB832",
            "payeeName": "Merchant1",
            "orderReference": "or-123456"
        }
    }
}
```

After the payment order is created, you can fetch it to get the available
operations. The operation you're interested in for the sake of the bare minimum
implementation is the `view-paymentsession`.

```json
{
  "paymentOrder": { ... }
  "operations": [
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "href": "{{ page.front_end_url }}/psp/paymentsessions/{{ page.payment_token }}?_tc_tid=30f2168171e142d38bcd4af2c3721959",
      "rel": "view-paymentsession",
      "contentType": "application/json"
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

The `href` from the operation is then used in the Android and iOS
implementations below.

## Android

Integrate the SDK in your application by simply adding the dependency to the
`build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.swedbankpay.mobilesdk:mobilesdk:{{ page.mobile_sdk_android_version }}'
}
```

Or in your `gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.swedbankpay.mobilesdk:mobilesdk:{{ page.mobile_sdk_android_version }}")
}
```

Depending on your app, you might also need to add
`androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1`

## Android Setup

If you would like the implementation to have basic return URL functionality
(that is, having the ability for external apps like Vipps and BankID to return
back to your app automatically after they are done) you need to make sure that
the payment URL will launch the app. A basic way to enable this is a custom URL
scheme (`examplepayment://`).

You can set this up using the template intent filter prepared in the SDK, that
uses a [Gradle Manifest Placeholder][gradle-manifest-placeholders]. You do this
by specifying your custom URL scheme in you `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
defaultConfig {
    manifestPlaceholders = [swedbankPaymentUrlScheme:"examplepayment"]
}
```

Or in your `gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
defaultConfig {
    manifestPlaceholders["swedbankPaymentUrlScheme"] = "examplepayment"
}
```

If you plan to use something other than `examplepayment://`, make sure to modify
the manifest placeholder value accordingly.

## Android SDK Payment Session

Next, you provide the Session URL and initiate a fetch of the payment session.
This will automatically configure the SDK with the URLs provided when creating
the payment order. You need to provide the `view-paymentsession` operation
`href` in the `sessionURL` parameter of `fetchPaymentSession()`.

```kotlin
val paymentSession = PaymentSession()

paymentSession.fetchPaymentSession(sessionURL = "{{ page.front_end_url }}/psp/paymentsessions/{{ page.payment_token }}?_tc_tid=30f2168171e142d38bcd4af2c3721959")
```

You have to wait until the payment session is fetched by the SDK, and can then
continue with either making payment attempts for native payment instruments, or
request a web view based payment flow.

You need to listen to some state updates from the Payment session. You do this
by observing `PaymentSession.paymentSessionState`. In the following example, we
implement observers for the four required states.

```kotlin
PaymentSession.paymentSessionState.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) { paymentState ->
    when (paymentState) {
        is PaymentSessionState.PaymentSessionFetched -> {
            Log.d("SwedbankPay", "Payment Session Fetched")
        }

        is PaymentSessionState.PaymentSessionComplete -> {
            Log.d("SwedbankPay", "Payment Session Complete")
        }

        is PaymentSessionState.PaymentSessionCanceled -> {
            Log.d("SwedbankPay", "Payment Session Canceled")
        }

        is PaymentSessionState.SessionProblemOccurred -> {
            Log.d("SwedbankPay", "Payment Session Problem Occurred")
        }

        is PaymentSessionState.SdkProblemOccurred -> {
            Log.d("SwedbankPay", "SDK Problem Occurred")
        }

        else -> {}
    }
}
```

## Android Present Payment

You are now ready to present the payment UI. You can ask the payment session
class to create a `PaymentFragment` for web view based payments:

```kotlin
paymentSession.createPaymentFragment()
```

After getting back the `PaymentFragment` instance , you can present it in a way
that works in your application. In this example we will be using Appcompat
`FragmentManager` via `supportFragmentManager` to present the payment fragment,
meaning this code is implemented in an `Activity` of the app.

```kotlin
val containerViewId = R.id.sdk_payment_fragment // Specify a container ID for the fragment
supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
    .add(containerViewId, paymentFragment, "PaymentFragment")
    .commit()
```

When the payment is finished, you need to remove the payment fragment from the
screen (again, in this example we’re accessing the Appcompat FragmentManager via
supportFragmentManager, so we're removing the payment view in a fragment
transaction to close it:

```kotlin
supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
    .remove(paymentFragment)
    .commit()
```

## Android Complete Code

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        val paymentSession = PaymentSession()

        paymentSession.fetchPaymentSession(sessionURL = "{{ page.front_end_url }}/psp/paymentsessions/{{ page.payment_token }}?_tc_tid=30f2168171e142d38bcd4af2c3721959")

        PaymentSession.paymentSessionState.observe(this) { paymentState ->
            when (paymentState) {
                is PaymentSessionState.PaymentSessionFetched -> {
                    Log.d("SwedbankPay", "Payment Session Fetched")

                    // Reqeust a web based payment fragment instance
                    paymentSession.createPaymentFragment()
                }

                is PaymentSessionState.ShowPaymentFragment -> {
                    Log.d("SwedbankPay", "Show Payment Fragment")

                    // Present payment fragment to user
                    val containerViewId = R.id.sdk_payment_fragment // Specify a container ID for the fragment
                    supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
                        .add(containerViewId, paymentState.fragment, "PaymentFragment")
                        .commit()
                }

                is PaymentSessionState.PaymentSessionComplete,
                is PaymentSessionState.PaymentSessionCanceled -> {
                    Log.d("SwedbankPay", "Payment Session Complete / Canceled")

                    // Remove the payment fragment
                    val paymentFragment = supportFragmentManager.findFragmentByTag("PaymentFragment")
                    if (paymentFragment != null) {
                        supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
                            .remove(paymentFragment)
                            .commit()
                    }
                }



                is PaymentSessionState.SessionProblemOccurred -> {
                    Log.d("SwedbankPay", "Payment Session Problem Occurred")
                }

                is PaymentSessionState.SdkProblemOccurred -> {
                    Log.d("SwedbankPay", "SDK Problem Occurred")
                }

                else -> {}
            }
        }
    }

}
```

## iOS

Integrate the SDK in your application by either using Swift Package Manager or
CocoaPods.

### Swift Package Manager

The package repository URL for the SDK is
[`https://github.com/SwedbankPay/swedbank-pay-sdk-ios.git`][sdk-package-repo]{:target="_blank"}.
Add the `SwedbankPaySDK` library, there is no need to add the
`SwedbankPaySDKMerchantBackend` library for the bare minimum implementation.

### CocoaPods

Add the dependency in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SwedbankPaySDK', '~> {{ page.mobile_sdk_ios_version }}'
```

## iOS Setup

If you would like the implementation to have basic return URL functionality
(that is, having the ability for external apps like Vipps and BankID to return
back to your app automatically after they are done) you need to make sure that
the payment URL will launch the app. A basic way to enable this is a custom URL
scheme (`examplepayment://`).

The easiest way to add a URL scheme to your app is to select the project file,
go to the `Info` tab, scroll down to `URL Types`, and click the `+` button to
add a new scheme. Insert `examplepayment` to the `URL Schemes` field. You can
choose the URL `Identifier` freely, but remember that that it should be unique.
The `Role` for the url type should be `Editor`. Finally, to mark this url type
as the Swedbank Pay payment url scheme, open the `Additional url type
properties`, and add a property with the key
`com.swedbank.SwedbankPaySDK.callback`, type `Boolean`, and value `YES`.

![Payment url scheme added in project Info tab][custom-scheme-1]

You can also edit the `Info.plist` file directly, if you wish.

![Payment url scheme added in Info.plist editor][custom-scheme-2]

If you plan to use something other than `examplepayment://`, make sure to modify
the URL scheme value accordingly.

To forward the custom-scheme payment urls to the SDK, implement the
[`application(_:open:options:)`][uiappdelegate-openurl]{:target="_blank"} method
in your application delegate, and call `SwedbankPaySDK.open(url: url)` to let
the SDK handle the url.

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    return SwedbankPaySDK.open(url: url)
}
```

## iOS SDK Payment Session

You need to listen to some state updates from the Payment session. You do this
by implementing the `SwedbankPaySDKPaymentSessionDelegate` protocol. In the
following example, we implement the delegate protocol and the required
methods.

```swift
func paymentSessionFetched(availableInstruments: [SwedbankPaySDK.AvailableInstrument]) {
    print("Available Instruments Fetched")
}

func sessionProblemOccurred(problem: SwedbankPaySDK.ProblemDetails) {
    print("Session Problem Occurred")
}

func sdkProblemOccurred(problem: SwedbankPaySDK.PaymentSessionProblem) {
    print("SDK Problem Occurred")
}

func paymentSessionComplete() {
    print("Payment Session Complete")
}

func paymentSessionCanceled() {
    print("Payment Session Canceled")
}

func showSwedbankPaySDKController(viewController: SwedbankPaySDK.SwedbankPaySDKController) {
    print("Show Swedbank Pay SDK Controller")
}

func show3DSecureViewController(viewController: UIViewController) {
    print("Show 3D Secure View Controller")
}

func dismiss3DSecureViewController() {
    print("Dismiss 3D Secure View Controller")
}

func paymentSession3DSecureViewControllerLoadFailed(error: Error, retry: @escaping ()->Void) {
    print("3D Secure View Controller Load Failed")
}
```

Next, you provide the Session URL and initiate a fetch of the payment session.
This will automatically configure the SDK with the URLs provided when creating
the payment order. You need to provide the `view-paymentsession` operation
`href` in the `sessionURL` parameter of `fetchPaymentSession()`.

```swift
let paymentSession = SwedbankPaySDK.SwedbankPayPaymentSession()

paymentSession.delegate = self

paymentSession.fetchPaymentSession(sessionURL: URL(string: "{{ page.front_end_url }}/psp/paymentsessions/{{ page.payment_token }}?_tc_tid=30f2168171e142d38bcd4af2c3721959")!)
```

You have to wait until the payment session is fetched by the SDK, and can then
continue with either making payment attempts for native payment instruments, or
request a web view based payment flow. For the bare minimum implementation,
we're only looking at the web view based payment flow, and you can therefore
ignore the `availableInstruments` parameter.

```swift
func paymentSessionFetched(availableInstruments: [SwedbankPaySDK.AvailableInstrument]) {
    // No need to look at availableInstruments, continue with showing the payment menu
}
```

## iOS Present Payment

You want to listen to some basic state updates from the payment UI and dismiss
the view when it's finished. We will be presenting the payment view controller
modally in the implementation further down, so we can use `dismiss()` to close
it:

```swift
func paymentSessionComplete() {
    dismiss(animated: true)
    print("Payment Session Complete")
}

func paymentSessionCanceled() {
    dismiss(animated: true)
    print("Payment Session Canceled")
}
```

You are now ready to present the payment UI. You can ask the payment session
class to create a `SwedbankPaySDKController` for web view based payments.

```swift
paymentSession.createSwedbankPaySDKController()
```

The `SwedbankPaySDKController` instance is returned via the
`showSwedbankPaySDKController(viewController:)` delegate method. After getting
back the `SwedbankPaySDKController` instance , you can present it in a way that
works in your application (again, in the example we're presenting the view
controller modally):

```swift
func showSwedbankPaySDKController(viewController: SwedbankPaySDK.SwedbankPaySDKController) {
    present(viewController, animated: true)
    print("Show Swedbank Pay SDK Controller")
}
```

You can now finish the payment in the web based Swedbank Pay Menu, and when the
payment is complete, you will be called with the `paymentComplete()` delegate
method and the payment menu will close.

## Limitations of the minimal implementation

While you can use the steps above to present a payment UI in your apps with very
little work, there are several limitations to the implementation that you should
consider before choosing how to implement the full payment in your apps.

### Dynamic Session URL

For simplicity, we've hardcoded the Session URL needed to fetch the payment
session in the SDK. In an actual application, you instead need to fetch this URL
from your own backend and supply it to the SDK.

### Cancelling payment

In this implementation, we haven't included a way for the user to cancel the
payment order. You could achieve this functionality by adding a cancel button
to your UI (for example providing a navigation bar with a close button for the
payment UI view controller/fragment), and cancelling the payment order via your
backend.

### Payment URL Handling

In this minimal implementation, we used custom URL scheme for the payment URL.
This causes several issues in a production environment:

*   On iOS, using custom URL schemes instead of Universal Links comes with
    several drawbacks, including prompting the user with an additional
    confirmation popup as well as being unable to verify URL ownership to your
    specific app (other apps can declare the same custom URL scheme outside of
    your control).
*   There are a few, albeit rare, scenarios where the user can end up launching
    the Payment URL in the mobile browser on their phone. For URLs with custom
    schemes that's handled nicely, but for universal URLs, it's more
    problematic. This means that browsing to the payment URL ideally should
    return a view that redirects the user to the app. We provide example on how
    to implement this in the next chapter [Custom Backend][payemnt-url].
