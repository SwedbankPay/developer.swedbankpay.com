We always strive to enhance and modernize our digital solution, so we have
developed a fresh visual User Interface (UI) design for our Digital Payments.

Our design aims to elevate both the user experience and the visual appeal of our
checkout web application. We incorporate the most current stylistic trends and
concepts that our experience team has been diligently refining and implementing
across the entire Swedbank Pay product lineup.

The design change encompasses various aspects, regardless if you use
Swedbank Pays payment menu or our payment methods. Additionally, we ensure that
the application complies with accessibility standards by making it compliant
with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 guidelines.

This commitment to accessibility guarantees that our checkout experience is
user-friendly and inclusive for all individuals. Read more about the changes
and how they support WCAG [here][wcag-presentation].

If you are using our **Seamless View** integration, here are your
[custom styling][custom-styling] options when the changes go live.
