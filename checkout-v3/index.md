## Choose The Right Implementation For Your Business

The customer journey varies a lot depending on your business vertical. If you're
selling physical goods like clothes, shoes or computers - you need to collect a
delivery address - unlike if you are selling digital goods, where that isn't
needed. But this is also a matter of which data you can and/or wish to collect
and manage yourself.

Here, you can choose between two main paths. Either you let us provide you the
**Full Checkout** solution (including both payer identification and payment
menu) - meaning the payer themselves chooses how to pay, or you can use the
**Payments Only** option. This means that you are in charge of collecting and
storing the payer data and the payment instruments to be presented.

Regardless of whether you choose to go with the full checkout or payments only,
we will supply you with a variety of payment instruments and features which
cater to your business needs. Somewhat depending on which country or countries
where you are present, we offer **Apple Pay (on iOS devices), card, invoice**
(incl. **monthly payments), MobilePay, Swish, Trustly** and **Vipps**.

-   **Authentication:** The process of verifying the payer's identity.

-   **Delivery Info:** Information about where the goods should be delivered.

-   **Payer Info:** The payerâ€™s personal data e.g. name, address, card number
    etc.

-   **PSP:** The service of providing payment instruments in the checkout.

## What Are You Looking For?
