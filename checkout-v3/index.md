## Choose The Right Implementation For Your Business

Each business vertical has a different customer journey. If you are selling
physical goods like clothes, shoes, or computers, you need to collect a delivery
address, unlike if you are selling digital goods. There is also the matter of
which data you can and/or wish to collect and manage on your own.

There are two main paths you can take here. If you choose the **Full Checkout**
solution (including payer identification as well as payment options), the payer
chooses the method of payment. You can also choose the **Payments Only** option.
In this case, you will collect and store payer data, along with the payment
instruments you will present to the payer. It is possible to use different
implementations per payment order within the **Full Checkout** options.
This is especially useful if you need different customer journeys based on the
device used.

We offer a variety of payment instruments and features designed to meet your
business' needs, regardless of whether you choose the **Full Checkout** or
**Payments Only**. You can choose from the following payment instruments,
somewhat depending on which countries you are operating in.

body="Some of the digital wallets we offer in Checkout v3 require you to take
additional steps before we can activate them for you. Please follow the link(s)
in the table below to read more." %}

{% include alert.html type="informative" icon="info" header="Credit Account"
body="Swedbank Pay Credit Account will be renamed Swedbank Pay Installment
Account during Q2 2023. The renaming will not have any technical
consequences, so you do not have to change anything in you integration." %}

## What Are You Looking For?

{% capture tab1_intro %}

## Full Checkout

The **Full Checkout** allows you to choose from a variety of payment options
specific to your local market, while we help you collect and safely store payer
data. Payment information can be stored so it can be prefilled next time the
payer shops if they agree to do so.
