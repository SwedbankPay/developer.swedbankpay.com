  The why and how to migrate from v1 to v3.1

## Why

The first main reason for migrating is the access to new development. All fresh
features and capabilities are exclusively released to Digital Payments, and will
not be available when using payment methods v1.

Likewise, new payment method additions like Google Pay, Apple Pay and Click to
Pay are only available when using payment order, and can't be set up as
individual payment methods.

The second main reason is maintenance. If you have 5 or 6 individual payments
methods, you also have 5 or 6 payment methods integrations. By switching to
Digital Payments v3.1 you only have the one.

Instead of having to do a new integration if you want to expand your payment
method offering, all of your activated payment methods are available in the same
integration.

## How

Migrating from individual payment methods to Digital Payments v3 does require a
full new integration, but as we already mentioned, you only have to do it once!
