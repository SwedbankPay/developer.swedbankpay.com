  The Seamless View purchase scenario shows you how to implement the checkin and
  payment menu directly in your webshop.
menu_order: 300
---

The **Starter Seamless View** integration consists of three main steps.
**Creating** the payment order and checkin, **displaying** the payment menu,
delivery options and checkin module in an iframe, and finally **capturing** the
funds. In addition, there are other post purchase options you need. We get to
them later on.

If you want to get an overview before proceeding, you can look at the
[sequence diagram][sequence-diagrams]. It is also available in the sidebar if
you want to look at it later. Let´s get going with the two first steps of the
integration.

## Step 1: Create Payment Order And Checkin

When the purchase is initiated, you need to create a payment order.

Start by performing a `POST` request towards the `paymentorder` resource
with payer information and a `completeUrl`.

We have added `productName` to the payment order request in this integration.
You can find it in the `paymentorder` field. This is required if you want to use
Checkout v3. If it isn´t included in your request, you won't get the correct
operations in the response.

When `productName` is set to `checkout3`, `requireConsumerInfo` and
`digitalProducts` will be set to `false` by default. For the **Starter**
integration, you must set `requireConsumerInfo` to `true`. If `digitalProducts`
is set to `false`, you also need to add
`shippingAddressRestrictedToCountryCodes` along with ISO standard country codes.

Supported features for this integration are subscriptions (`recur` and
`unscheduled MIT`), instrument mode and split settlement (`subsite`).

There is also a guest mode option for the payers who don't wish to store their
information. When using **Starter**, this is triggered when the payer chooses
not to store credentials during checkin.

In some instances you need the possibility to abort purchases. This could be if
a payer does not complete the purchase within a reasonable timeframe. For those
instances we have `abort`, which you can read about in the [core
features][abort-feature]. You can only use `abort` if the payer **has not**
completed an `authorize` or a `sale`.

## Step 2: Display Checkin, Delivery Options And Payment Menu

Among the operations in the POST `paymentOrders` response, you will find
`view-checkout`. This is what you need to display the checkin and payment
module.

{:.code-view-header}
**Response**

```json
{
    "paymentOrder": {
    "operations": [
        {
            "method": "GET",
            "href": "https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/payment/core/js/px.payment.client.js?token=dd728a47e3ec7be442c98eafcfd9b0207377ce04c793407eb36d07faa69a32df&culture=sv-SE&_tc_tid=30f2168171e142d38bcd4af2c3721959",
            "rel": "view-checkout",
            "contentType": "application/javascript"
        },
    ]
}
```

## Load The Seamless View

Embed the `href` in a `<script>` element. That script will then load the
Seamless View.

To load the Checkout from the JavaScript URL obtained in the backend API
response, it needs to be set as a script element’s `src` attribute. You can
cause a page reload and do this with static HTML, or you can avoid the page
refresh by invoking the POST to create the payment order through Ajax, and then
create the script element with JavaScript. The HTML code will be unchanged in
this example.

{:.code-view-header}
**JavaScript**

```js
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    response = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    var operation = response.operations.find(function (o) {
        return o.rel === 'view-checkout';
    });
    script.setAttribute('src', operation.href);
    script.onload = function () {
        // When the 'view-checkout' script is loaded, we can initialize the
        // Payment Menu inside our 'payment-menu' container.
        // To open the Checkin
        window.payex.hostedView.checkout({
            container: {
                checkin: "checkin",
                paymentMenu: "paymentMenu",
            },
            culture: 'nb-No',
            // If payer is identified
            onPayerIdentified: function onPayerIdentified(payerIdentified) {
                console.log(payerIdentified);
            },
            // If payer chooses "Not you?"
            onPayerUnidentified: function onPayerUnidentified(payerUnidentified) {
            console.log(payerUnidentified);
            },
            onEventNotification: function onEventNotification(eventNotification) {
                console.log(eventNotification);
            },
        }).open("checkin");
    };
    // Append the Checkout script to the <head>
    var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
    head.appendChild(script);
});
// Like before, you should replace the address here with
// your own endpoint.
request.open('GET', '<Your-Backend-Endpoint-Here>', true);
request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json; charset=utf-8');
request.send();
```

When you get notified about the event `onPayerIdentified`, you need to do a
`GET` on the `paymentOrder`. By expanding the `payer` field, you should get all
the info you need to calculate shipping costs. You can now update the
paymentOrder with a `PATCH` if you need to, using the patch from `operations` in
the `paymentOrder` response.

{:.code-view-header}
**Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

        {
            "method": "PATCH",
            "href": "{{ page.front_end_url }}/paymentorders/{{ page.payment_order_id }}",
            "rel": "update-order",
            "contentType": "application/json"
        }
```

{:.code-view-header}
**JavaScript**

```js
//to open the Payment Menu
window.payex.hostedView.checkout({
    container: {
        checkin: "checkin",
        paymentMenu: "paymentMenu",
    },
    culture: 'nb-No',
}).open("paymentmenu");
```

{:.code-view-header}
**HTML**

```html
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Swedbank Pay Checkout is Awesome!</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="checkin"></div>
            <div id="payment-menu"></div>
            <!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file -->
            <script src="<Your-JavaScript-File-Here>"></script>
        </body>
    </html>
```

## How It Looks

First you will see a Checkin module where the payer can enter their email and
phone number.

{:.text-center}
![screenshot of the starter implementation seamless view checkin][login-checkin]

A known payer will be sent directly to the payment menu shown further below. If
we detect that the payer is new, we give them the option to store their details
or proceed without storing. If that happens, these checkin steps will appear.

{:.text-center}
![screenshot of asking the payer to store details][checkin-new-payer]

After choosing yes or no, the payer must enter their SSN.

{:.text-center}
![screenshot of asking the payer to enter SSN while storing details][checkin-new-payer-ssn]

With digital products, the payer will be sent directly to delivery options after
they select to store their details (see below). For mixed goods, the SSN input
view will expand and the payer must enter their shipping address. Payers
choosing not to store credentials (guests) must also enter their shipping
address.

{:.text-center}
![screenshot of the seamless view checkin when entering details][checkin-enter-details-mixed]

After checking in, the payer's contact details and shipping address are shown
for mixed goods. Note the new "Remember me" checkbox. The first time the checks
in, the box will appear unchecked. If checked during a purchase, it will appear
like the screenshot below during future check-ins, with a "Not you?" option in
the top right corner.

You can now perform the `GET` on the payment order and display the available
delivery option(s) to the payer. How the delivery options are displayed is up to
you. This is how they appear in our demoshop.

{:.text-center}
![screenshot of the seamless view checkin mixed and delivery options][checkin-delivery-options-mixed]

For digital products, only contact details will be shown. "Remember me" will
work the same way as with mixed goods.

{:.text-center}
![screenshot of the seamless view checkin digital and delivery options][checkin-delivery-options-digital]

When the payer chooses a delivery option, you can `PATCH` the payment order and
open the payment menu. The payer can then proceed with the purchase.

{:.text-center}
![screenshot of the starter implementation seamless view payment menu][seamless-payment-menu-starter]

Once a purchase is complete, you can perform a `GET` towards the `paymentOrders`
resource to see the purchase state.

### Events

When integrating Seamless View, especially with **Starter** where it's the only
option, we strongly recommend that you implement the `onPaid` event, as it will
give you the best setup. Even with this implemented, you need to check the
payment status towards our APIs, as the payer can make changes in the browser at
any time.

When implementing **Starter**, you also need to subscribe to the event
[`onPayerUnidentified`][onpayerunidentified] when you implement
[`onPayerIdentified`][onpayeridentified]. This is needed for the "Remember Me"
feature to work. It is a part of the acceptance criteria, meaning you won't get
the green light to go live with your **Starter** implementation without it.

You can read more about the different [Seamless View
Events][seamless-view-events] available in the feature section.
