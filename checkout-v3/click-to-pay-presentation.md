Click to Pay makes it easy for payers to check out, no matter what online
payment channel they choose. All cards are stored in a portable profile they can
be used securely whenever the Click to Pay icon is present. Built on EMV
standards, Click to Pay is a password-free checkout option that delivers
security, convenience and control to the payers.

Unless you have requested Click to Pay as part of signing your agreement with
Swedbank Pay, you can e-mail a request to **agreement@swedbankpay.com** together
with **Name**, **Organizational** and **Customer number**.
