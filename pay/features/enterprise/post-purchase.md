  When the payer has **completed** the purchase, you need to implement the
  relevant **post purchase operations** in your order system. These operations,
  and how they are executed, are described below.

The purchase should now be complete. But what if the purchase is cancelled or
the payer wants to return goods? For these instances, we have `cancel` and
`reversal`.

{% include payment-order-cancel.md %}

{% include payment-order-reversal.md %}

{% include iterator.html prev_href="redirect"
                         prev_title="Implement Redirect" %}

{% include iterator.html prev_href="seamless-view"
                         prev_title="Implement Seamless View" %}
