## Operations

When a payment order resource is created and during its lifetime, it will have
a set of operations that can be performed on it.
The state of the payment order resource, what the access token is authorized
to do, the chosen payment instrument and its transactional states, etc.
determine the available operations before the initial purchase.
A list of possible operations and their explanation is given below.

{% include alert.html type="informative" icon="info" header="Deprecated
Operations." body="Payment instrument-specific operations are passed
through Payment Order. These can be recognized by not having
`paymentorder` in the `rel` value. They will be described and marked as
deprecated in the operation list below." %}

| Field         | Type     | Description                                                                        |
| :------------ | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `href`        | `string` | The target URL to perform the operation against.                                   |
| `rel`         | `string` | The name of the relation the operation has to the current resource.                |
| `method`      | `string` | `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST`, etc.Â The HTTP method to use when performing the operation. |
| `contentType` | `string` | The HTTP content type of the resource referenced in the `href` field.              |

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as
described here in the documentation. Always use the `href` and `method` as
specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its
`rel` value. The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value
of the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request
for the given operation.
