## Frictionless Payments

When dealing with card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is
an essential topic. 3-D Secure 2 is an improved version of the old protocol, now
allowing frictionless payments where transactions can be completed without
input from the cardholder. To increase the chances of this, there are certain
fields that should be included in your request. The more information you add,
the better.
