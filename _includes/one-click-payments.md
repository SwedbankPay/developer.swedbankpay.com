## One-Click Payments

{% include jumbotron.html body="One-Click Payments utilize a previously
generated payment token to prefill payment details for credit card or
invoice payments pages - which means that the payer don't need to enter
these details for every purchase." %}

## Introduction

{% if documentation_section contains "checkout-v3" %}

For card and invoice payments, the payment flow and implementation varies from
your default only being the use of a `paymentToken`. The details in this section
describe explicitly the parameters that must be set to enable one-click
purchases.

{% else %}

For [card][card] and [invoice][invoice] payments, the payment flow and
implementation varies from your default only being the use of a `paymentToken`.
The details in this section describe explicitly the parameters that must be set
to enable one-click purchases.

{% endif %}

## Generate The Payment Token

When making the initial purchase request, you need to generate a `paymentToken`.
You can do this either by by setting the `generatePaymentToken` field to
`true` (see example below) when doing a card purchase, or set the initial
operation to [`Verify`][verify].

{:.code-view-header}
**generatePaymentToken field**

```json
{
    "generatePaymentToken": true,
    "payer": {
    "payerReference": "AB1234",
    }
}
```

## GET Payment Token

When the initial purchase is successful, a `paymentToken` is linked to
the payment.  You can return the value by sending a `GET` request towards the
payment resource (expanding either the authorizations or verifications
sub-resource), after the payer successfully has completed the purchase. The two
examples are provided below.

{:.code-view-header}
**Request Towards Authorizations Resource**

```http
GET  {{ verification_url }} HTTP/1.1
Host: {{ page.api_host }}
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
```

{:.code-view-header}
**Request Towards Verifications Resource**

```http
GET {{ authorization_url }} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
```

You need to store the `paymentToken` from the response in your system and keep
track of the corresponding `payerReference` in your system.

## Returning Purchases

When a known payer (where you have attained a `payerReference` or similar)
returns to your system, you can use the `paymentToken`, using already stored
payment data, to initiate one-click payments. You will need to make a standard
purchase, following the sequence as specified in the Redirect or Seamless View
scenarios for [credit card][card] and [financing invoice][invoice]. When
creating the first `POST` request you insert the `paymentToken` field. This must
be the `paymentToken` you received in the initial purchase, where you specified
the `generatePaymentToken` to `true`.

{% unless documentation_section contains "checkout-v3" %}

See the Features section for how to create a [card][create-card-payment]
and [invoice][create-invoice-payment] payment.

### Delete Payment Token

If you need to delete a `paymentToken`, you have two options. The first is by
`payerReference`, which deletes all payment, recurrence and/or unscheduled
tokens associated with the payer. The second is by `paymentToken`, which only
deletes a specific token.

{% include alert.html type="warning"
                      icon="warning"
                      body="Please note that this call does not erase the card
  number stored at Swedbank Pay.
  A card number is automatically deleted six months after a successful
  `Delete payment token` request.
  If you want card information removed at an earlier date, you need to contact
  [ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.dk](mailto:ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.dk),
  [verkkokauppa.setup@swedbankpay.fi](mailto:verkkokauppa.setup@swedbankpay.fi),
  [ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.no](mailto:ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.no) or
  [ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.se](mailto:ehandelsetup@swedbankpay.se);
  and supply them with the relevant transaction reference or payment token." %}

If you want to delete tokens by `payerReference`, the request and response
should look like this:

{:.code-view-header}

```

{% comment %}

      explaining each field here.

{:.code-view-header}

        "id": "/psp/paymentorders/payerownedtokens/{payerReference}",

                    "zipCode": "1642"
                }
            },
            {
                "token": "{paymentToken}",
                "tokenType": "Unscheduled",
                "instrument": "CreditCard",
                "instrumentDisplayName": "492500******0004",
                "instrumentParameters": {
                    "expiryDate": "12/2020",
                    "cardBrand": "Visa"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

For single token deletions, the request and response should look like this. In
this example, the token is connected to a card. If it was an invoice connected
token, the `instrumentDisplayName` would be the payer's date of birth.
