{{ h }} Transactions

{% if api_resource == "paymentorders" -%}
A payment order contains one or more `payment` sub-resources, which in turn
contain sub-resources in the form of `transactions`.
{% else -%}
A payment contains sub-resources in the form of `transactions`.
{% endif -%}

Most operations performed on a payment ends up as a `transaction` resource. The
different types of operations that alter the state of the payment by creating a
transaction is described below.

The `transactions` resource will list the transactions (one or more) on a
specific payment.
