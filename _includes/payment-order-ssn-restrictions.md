## Restrict Payments To A Social Security Number

Swedbank Pay provides the possibility to restrict payments to a Social Security
Number for payment instruments which support this. This can be used when you
want to make sure you only accept payments from an already identified
individual.

You do this by adding the field `restrictedToSocialSecurityNumber` in the
`payer` field, in your payment order request, and setting it to `true`. This
will leave out all instruments which do not support this feature.

It will then use the `socialSecurityNumber` located in the `nationalIdentifier`
field (found within the `payer` field). The `nationalIdentifier` must be
included to use this feature. Instruments supporting the feature will reject
payments that do not match the restriction.

{% if documentation_section contains "checkout-v3/enterprise" %} If you want to
use the Social Security Number just for payment restrictions, and not do a
checkout profile lookup, add the parameter `guestMode` in the
`nationalIdentifier` field and set it to `true`. {% endif %}

You are currently only able to restrict Swish and Trustly payments to a Social
Security Number, but we will add support for more payment instruments going
forward. No changes are required at your (the merchant’s) end to be able to
offer more instruments at a later time.

## Restrict To Social Security Number Request

The field itself is a `bool` which must be added in the `payer` field of the
request. Below is a shortened example of a payment order request. Apart from the
new field, the payment request is similar to a standard payment order request.
For an example of a payment order request, {% if documentation_section contains
"checkout-v3/enterprise" %} [click
here.](/checkout-v3/enterprise/redirect#payment-order-request) {% endif %} {% if
documentation_section contains "checkout-v3/payments-only" %} [click
here.](/checkout-v3/payments-only/redirect#payment-order-request) {% endif %}
The response will be similar to a standard payment order response, which is also
documented on the page linked above.
