### Operations

A payment resource has a set of operations that can be performed on it, from its creation to its end. The operations available at any given time vary between payment methods and depends on the current state of the payment resource. A list of possible operations for Direct Debit Payments and their explanation is given below.

{:.code-header}
**Operations**

```JS
{
    "operations": [
        {
            "method": "PATCH",
            "href": "https://api.externalintegration.payex.com/psp/directdebit/payments/3648fa94-7fd8-4e32-a14b-08d608f884ff",
            "rel": "update-payment-abort"
        },
        {
            "method": "GET",
            "href": "https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/directdebit/payments/sales/993b479653da83671c074316c7455da05fced9d634431edbb64f3c5f80a863f0",
            "rel": "redirect-sale"
        }
    ]
}
```

{:.table .table-striped}
| **Property** | **Description**
| href |The target URI to perform the operation against.
| rel |The name of the relation the operation has to the current resource.
| method |The HTTP method to use when performing the operation.

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as described here in the documentation. Always use the `href` and `method` as specified in the response by finding the appropriate operation based on its `rel` value. The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request for the given operation.

| **Operation** | **Description**
| update-payment-abort |[Aborts][technical-reference-abort] the payment before any financial transactions are performed.
| redirect-sale |Contains the redirect-URI that redirects the consumer to a PayEx hosted payments page prior to creating a sales transaction.

### Direct Debit transactions 

All Direct Debit specific transactions are described below. Read more about the general transaction resource [here][core-payment-resources-transactions].
