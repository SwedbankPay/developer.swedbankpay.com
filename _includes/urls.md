## URLs

When creating a Payment Order, the `urls` field of the `paymentOrder`
contains the related URLs, including where the payer is redirected when
going forward with or cancelling a payment session, as well as the callback URL
that is used to inform the payee (merchant) of changes or updates made to
underlying payments or transaction.
