## Problems

When performing operations against a resource in the Swedbank Pay API Platform,
it will respond with a problem message that contain details of the error type if
the request could not be successfully performed. Regardless of why the error
occurred, the problem message will follow the same structure as specified in the
[Problem Details for HTTP APIs (RFC 7807)][rfc-7807] specification.

We generally use the problem message `type` and `status` code to identify the
nature of the problem. The `problems` array contains objects with `name` and
`description` that will often help narrow down the specifics of the problem,
usually to the field in the request that was missing or contained invalid data.

The structure of a problem message will look like this:

{% capture response_content %}{
    "type": "https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/<resource>/inputerror",
    "title": "There was an input error",
    "detail": "Please correct the errors and retry the request",
    "instance": "{{ page.transaction_id }}",
    "status": 400,
    "problems": [{
        "name": "CreditCardParameters.Issuer",
        "description": "minimum one issuer must be enabled"
    }]
}{% endcapture %}

{% include code-example.html

    json= response_content
    %}

## Common Problems

All common problem types will have a URL in the format
`https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/<error-type>`. The **URL is an
identifier** that you can hard-code and implement logic around. It is currently
not not possible to dereference this URL, although that might be possible in the
future.

{:.table .table-striped}
| Type                 | Status | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------- | :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inputerror`         | `400`  | The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g. malformed request syntax, size to large, invalid request). |
| `configurationerror` | `403`  | A error relating to configuration issues.   |
| `forbidden`          | `403`  | The request was valid, but the server is refusing the action. The necessary permissions to access the resource might be lacking.                   |
| `notfound`           | `404`  | The requested resource could not be found, but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests are permissible.                                |
| `systemerror`        | `500`  | A generic error message.                 |

## Token Problems

We will be making a change in the error messages that are given in response in
the eCommerce API if the requested `Payment`/`One-Click`/`Recur`/`Unscheduled`
token does not exist or is deleted.

The following new `errorType` will be introduced (only for Payment Order):
`https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/paymenttokeninactive`

In addition to the one currently in use for both Payment Instruments and Payment
Order:
`https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/inputerror`

First, a check is made to verify if the token exists or not. If it does not
exist, the API returns an error of the type `InputError`. If, however, the token
exists but is deleted, the API will return the error `TokenInactive`.

Examples of the error messages are presented below.

### InputError

`InputError` for a `RecurrenceToken`:

{% capture response_content %}{
   "type":"https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/inputerror",
   "title":"Error in input data",
   "status":404,
   "instance":"https://api.payex.com/psp/probleminstance/00-e53deef0eb5e47bcb5ba1739bdd9086c-
    b5512dfc02b74f07-01",
   "detail":"Input validation failed, error description in problems node!",
   "problems":
   [
      {
         "name":"RecurrenceToken",
         "description":"The given RecurrenceToken does not exist."
      }
   ]
}{% endcapture %}

{% include code-example.html
    title='InputError for RecurrenceToken'
    header=response_header
    json= response_content
    %}

### TokenInactive

`TokenInactive` example with `UnscheduledToken`:

{% capture response_content %}{
    "type": "https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/paymenttokeninactive",
    "title": "Payment token is inactive",
    "status": 422,
    "instance": "https://api.payex.com/psp/probleminstance/00-2fc18bd40743401596bf2de3b51ab16d-
     bfebd4ae81ea8423-01",
    "detail": "The given UnscheduledToken is inactive.",
    "problems":
     [
       {
           "name": "UnscheduledToken",
           "description": "The given UnscheduledToken is inactive."
        }
    ]
}{% endcapture %}

{% include code-example.html
    title='TokenInactive for UnscheduledToken'
    header=response_header
    json= response_content
    %}

`TokenInactive` example with a `RecurrenceToken`:

{% capture response_content %}{
    "type": "https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/paymenttokeninactive",
    "title": "Payment token is inactive",
    "status": 422,
    "instance": "https://api.payex.com/psp/probleminstance/00-2fc18bd40743401596bf2de3b51ab16d-
     bfebd4ae81ea8423-01",
    "detail": "The given RecurrenceToken is inactive.",
    "problems":
     [
       {
           "name": "UnscheduledToken",
           "description": "The given RecurrenceToken is inactive."
        }
    ]
}{% endcapture %}

{% include code-example.html
    title='TokenInactive for RecurrenceToken'
    header=response_header
    json= response_content
    %}

If you have questions regarding the new error types, do not hesitate to contact
us through the ordinary support channels.

## Payment Details Problems

In order to use the new parameter `EnablePaymentDetailsConsentCheckbox` – which
determines whether or not to show the checkbox used to save payment details –
the `DisableStoredPaymentDetails` parameter must be set to `true`. Otherwise you
will get a validation error.

{% capture response_content %}{
    "type": "https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/inputerror",
    "title": "Error in input data",
    "status": 400,
    "instance": "https://api.payex.com/psp/probleminstance/00-f75cfaedb1eb467bbefd4917c67a7664-b25fb23de26682e9-01",
    "detail": "Input validation failed, error description in problems node!",
    "problems": [
        {
            "name": "PaymentOrder.EnablePaymentDetailsConsentCheckbox",
            "description": "EnablePaymentDetailsConsentCheckbox cannot be used without DisableStoredPaymentDetails."
        }
    ]
}{% endcapture %}

{% include code-example.html
    title='Consent Checkbox Problems'
    header=response_header
    json= response_content
    %}

## Card Problems

There are a few problems specific to the `creditcard` resource that you may want
to guard against in your integrations. All credit card problem types will have
the following URL structure:

`https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/creditcard/<error-type>`

### Creditcard Payments MIT - Do Not Try Again & Excessive Reattempts

In accordance with directives from Visa and Mastercard, we will be implementing
2 different types of limitations in the amount of successive reattempts of a
previously failed transaction using either a `recurrence`- or `unscheduledToken`
that can be done using card based payment instruments. This limitation has up
until now been handled by Swedbank Pay Acquiring, but will now be handled
earlier in the transaction process - enabling us to provide better and clearer
response messages through the eCommerce-api.

To test these response messages, we have added new magic amounts in the
[test data section][test-data]. The new amounts are for `DAILYLIMITEXCEEDED`,
`MONTHLYLIMITEXCEEDED`, `DONOTRETRY` and `MODIFICATIONSREQUIRED`.
SuspensionWarning can be tested by using the `limit exceeded` amounts.

One such limitation will be limiting the amount of successive reattempts of a
previously failed transaction that can be done using creditcard based payment
method within a specified period The limitation in question varies based on the
card brand:

*   MasterCard - 10 failed payment attempts allowed during a period of **24 hours**.
*   Visa - 15 failed payment attempts allowed during a period of **30 days**.

Note that all of the attempts has to get a failed response to be added to the
limit quota - if a transaction goes through successfully, the quota will reset.

The other limitation that will be implemented is in the case that Visa or
Mastercard gives such a response that is flagged as "Do Not Retry" in accordance
to Visa and MasterCard regulations. This response is given in the cases that
they deem the transaction to never be possible to be valid - as an example, if
the card no longer exists, and thus there is no point in retrying.

In these cases, the card will be blocked immediately and no further attempts are
allowed.

Both of these limitations are based on the combination of the acquiring
agreement that the transaction was initiated from, and the PAN of the card that
was used. That is, a card might be blocked because of "Excessive Reattempts" at
a particular merchant, while being allowed more reattempts at another. Please
note that in the case a new card is issued in place of an old expired one, the
new card usually keeps the same PAN - meaning that if the old card was blocked,
the new one will be as well (until the period resets). This marks the importance
of having such a logic in place that limits reattempts before the block actually
takes place - this is where the new, clearer response messages will help.

When it comes to Excessive Reattempts, the new response messages will be
returned if the quota for the period gets to 5 attempts remaining, as follows:
