## Problems

When performing operations against a resource in the Swedbank Pay API Platform,
it will respond with a problem message that contain details of the error type if
the request could not be successfully performed. Regardless of why the error
occurred, the problem message will follow the same structure as specified in the
[Problem Details for HTTP APIs (RFC 7807)][rfc-7807] specification.

We generally use the problem message `type` and `status` code to identify the
nature of the problem. The `problems` array contains objects with `name` and
`description` that will often help narrow down the specifics of the problem,
usually to the field in the request that was missing or contained invalid data.

The structure of a problem message will look like this:

{:.code-view-header}

## Common Problems

All common problem types will have a URL in the format
`https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/<error-type>`. The **URL is an
identifier** that you can hard-code and implement logic around. It is currently
not not possible to dereference this URL, although that might be possible in the
future.

{:.table .table-striped}
| Type                 | Status | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------- | :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inputerror`         | `400`  | The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g. malformed request syntax, size to large, invalid request). |
| `configurationerror` | `403`  | A error relating to configuration issues.   |
| `forbidden`          | `403`  | The request was valid, but the server is refusing the action. The necessary permissions to access the resource might be lacking.                   |
| `notfound`           | `404`  | The requested resource could not be found, but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests are permissible.                                |
| `systemerror`        | `500`  | A generic error message.                 |

## Token Problems

We will be making a change in the error messages that are given in response in
the eCommerce API if the requested `Payment`/`One-Click`/`Recur`/`Unscheduled`
token does not exist or is deleted.

The following new `errorType` will be introduced (only for Payment Order):
`https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/paymenttokeninactive`

In addition to the one currently in use for both Payment Instruments and Payment
Order:
`https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/inputerror`

First, a check is made to verify if the token exists or not. If it does not
exist, the API returns an error of the type `InputError`. If, however, the token
exists but is deleted, the API will return the error `TokenInactive`.

Examples of the error messages are presented below.

`InputError`, in this instance for a `RecurrenceToken`:

```json
{
   "type":"https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/inputerror",
   "title":"Error in input data",
   "status":404,
   "instance":"https://api.payex.com/psp/probleminstance/00-e53deef0eb5e47bcb5ba1739bdd9086c-
    b5512dfc02b74f07-01",
   "detail":"Input validation failed, error description in problems node!",
   "problems":
   [
      {
         "name":"RecurrenceToken",
         "description":"The given RecurrenceToken does not exist."
      }
   ]
}
```

`TokenInactive`, in this instance for an `UnscheduledToken`:

```json
{
    "type": "https://api.payex.com/psp/errordetail/paymentorders/paymenttokeninactive",
    "title": "Payment token is inactive",
    "status": 422,
    "instance": "https://api.payex.com/psp/probleminstance/00-2fc18bd40743401596bf2de3b51ab16d-
     bfebd4ae81ea8423-01",
    "detail": "The given UnscheduledToken is inactive.",
    "problems":
     [
       {
           "name": "UnscheduledToken",
           "description": "The given UnscheduledToken is inactive."
        }
    ]
}
```

If you have questions regarding the new error types, do not hesitate to contact
us through the ordinary support channels.

## Card Problems

There are a few problems specific to the `creditcard` resource that you may want
