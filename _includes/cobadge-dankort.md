## Co-badge Card Choice For Dankort

Due to new [EU regulations from 2016-06-09][eu-regulation] regarding cards that
have more than one payment application, we have developed support for the end
users of Dankort to be able to choose their preferred payment application on the
Swedbank Pay payment page. If you are a Dankort user, read more about this
feature at [Dankort][dankort-eu].

As a merchant you can set a priority selection of payment application by
contacting [Swedbank Pay Support][swedbankpay-support]. The payer will always
be able to override this priority selection on the payment page.

If you want more information about Co-badge Card Choice for Dankort users,
please contact [Swedbank Pay Support][swedbankpay-support]. The example below
shows the payment window where the payer can choose between Dankort or Visa
before completing the payment.
