## Cross Channel Payments

Swedbank Pay's Checkout v3 API is built in a way that depends on that you, as a
merchant, is able to store the `paymentOrderId`. The `paymentOrderId` is a URL
which points to the specific instance of a payment order resource, but in some
cases it will be hard to use it as a payment reference.

To help you keep track of the transaction easier, we provide a unique
identification called `referenceCode` in all v3 implementations. The code can
then be printed and, for instance, used as a scannable barcode for future
tracking.

The `referenceCode` isn't available by default, but needs to be activated by us
to appear in your payment order responses.

## Reference Code Query

When enabled, the `referenceCode` will appear as a 16 digit code in the expanded
`paid` field when the payment is fully paid.

In addition to the regular `GET` method, you may obtain information about the
payment by doing a `QUERY` with the `referenceCode` in the JSON body as shown in
the below example.

Both `GET` and `QUERY` responses will look like the abbreviated `paid`
example below. The parts omitted from this example will look like the response
from a regular `GET` request.
