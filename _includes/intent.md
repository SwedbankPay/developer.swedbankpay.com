### Intent

The intent of the payment identifies how and when the charge will be
effectuated. This determines the type of transaction used during the payment
process.

{% if show_authorization == true %}

*   **`Authorization` (two-phase)**: If you want the card to reserve the
    amount, you will have to specify that the `intent` of the `Purchase` is
    `Authorization`. The amount will be reserved but not charged. You will (i.e.
    when you are ready to ship the purchased products) have to make a
    [Capture]({{ features_url }}/capture) or [Cancel]({{ features_url }}/cancel)
    request later on to fulfill the transaction.
{% endif %}
{% if autocapture %}
*   **`AutoCapture` (one-phase)**: If you want the card to be charged
    (without additional operations), you will have to specify that the `intent`
    of the `Purchase` is `AutoCapture`. This is normally only allowed if the
    payer purchases digital products with instant delivery/shipment. Check with
    your acquirer before using this feature. The amount will be reserved via the
    authorization and the credit card will be charged automatically. You don't
    need to do any more financial operations to fulfill the transaction.
{% endif %}
{% if sale %}
*   **`Sale` (one-phase)**: The `sale` intent is used by the payment methods
    like Swish, where the funds are reserved and drawn from the payer's account
    immediately. This means you don't need to do any more financial operations
    to fulfill the transaction. The only available after payment operation is
    `reversal`.
