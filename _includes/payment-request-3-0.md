The integration consists of four main steps. **Creating** the payment order,
**displaying** the payment menu, **validating** the payment's status and
**capturing** the funds. In addition, there are other post-purchase options you
need. We get to them later on.

#### Before You Start

Both the payment request and other API calls are available and ready to use in
our [collection of Online Payment APIs][testsuite]{:target="_blank"}. You can
use the collection with your own test account or with the provided generic test
merchant.

Depending on what you plan to include in your offering, we recommend stopping
by the pages specific to each payment method.

Some of them – like the digital wallets [Apple Pay][apple-pay]{:target="_blank"},
[Click to Pay][c2p]{:target="_blank"} and [Google Pay][google-pay]{:target="_blank"} –
have steps which must be completed before the payment method can be activated.

For [Swish][swish]{:target="_blank"} and [Trustly][trustly]{:target="_blank"},
we provide useful integration recommendations.

### Create Payment Order v3.0

When your customer has initiated a purchase, you need to create a payment order.

Start by performing a `POST` request towards the `paymentorder` resource
with payer information and a `completeUrl`.

`POST`, `PATCH` and `PUT` requests use this header for v3.0:

`Content-Type: application/json;version=3.0`

`GET` requests use this header:

`Accept: application/json;version=3.0`

We have added `productName` to the payment order request in this integration.
You can find it in the `paymentorder` field. This is no longer required, but is
an option to use v3.0 of Online Payments. To use `productName`, simply put
`Checkout3` as the value in that field in the request. If you specify version in
the header, you can leave out the `productName` field.

When `productName` is set to `checkout3`, `digitalProducts` will be set to
`false` by default.

Supported features for this integration are subscriptions (`recur`, `one-click`
and `unscheduled MIT`), `MOTO`, instrument mode, split settlement (`subsite`)
and the possibility to use your own `logo`.

There is also a guest mode option for the payers who don't wish to store their
information. The way to trigger this is to not include the `payerReference`
field in your `paymentOrder` request. If the `payer` field is included in your
request, you can find the `payerReference` there.

Sometimes you might need to abort purchases. An example could be if a payer does
not complete the purchase within a reasonable timeframe. For those instances we
have `abort`, which you can read about in the [payment operations][abort-feature].
You can only use `abort` if the payer **has not** completed an `authorize` or a
`sale`. If the payer is performing an action at a 3rd party, like the MobilePay,
Swish or Vipps apps, `abort` is unavailable.

### GDPR

When adding information to the `Payer` object for the purpose of pre-filling or
storing any data connected to the payer, you must first obtain their **explicit**
**consent**. In general, this consent can be collected when the payer provides
their delivery information, such as during the checkout or registration process.

Examples of such fields include:

*   `firstName`
*   `lastName`
*   `email`
*   `MSISDN`

If you are linking payer information to a profile (`payerReference`) or using
stored credentials for express checkouts, **do not use sensitive identifiers** —
such as email addresses, phone numbers, or social security numbers—in fields
like `payerReference`. These fields are **not intended to hold personal data**,
and therefore **do not offer the same level of protection or processing**
**safeguards** as fields explicitly designed for sensitive information under
GDPR.

If the use of sensitive data is absolutely necessary, it must be **hashed**
before being sent in any request to Swedbank Pay. The hash must be meaningful
only to you, the merchant or integrator, and **does not need to be reversible by**
**Swedbank Pay**. This means you are solely responsible for generating the hash
and, if needed, securely mapping it back to the original data on your side. The
responsibility for ensuring the **lawful processing, protection, and handling**
**of personal data** — both during and after the transaction — **rests entirely**
**with you**.
