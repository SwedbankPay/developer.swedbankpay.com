## Settlement and Reconcilliation

{% include jumbotron.html body="Reconciliation is an important step in an
economic transaction. When a payment is reconciled,  captured amounts for
the payment are matched against the corresponding settlement." %}

The information needed to reconcile captured funds - the balance report and transactions list - are available for all merchants using PayEx. By default you receive these files by e-mail, but it is also possible to get them via FTP access. Contact [omni.client@payex.com][omni-client-email] for further inquiries regarding this. The settlement frequency is defined in the agreement and you will receive a report for each payout and/or invoice.

### Settlement

There are two main alternatives for settlement - either we handle the settlement process for you, or you handle the process yourself :

#### PayEx handles the settlement process

PayEx handles the settlement process on your behalf, (_called “Redovisningsservice”_). PayEx transfers the net amount to you directly.

##### PayEx Checkout

When choosing [PayEx Checkout][payex-checkout] we always handle the settlement process for you, gathering all your eCommerce payments in one place. Straighforward and time efficient.

#### You handle the settlement process yourself

If you will handle the settlement yourself, then PayEx will send you an invoice with the relevant fees, in addition to the report and transactions lists. Your acquirer will transfer settled funds to you.

#### Balance Report

The Balance Report (a _.pdf file_) specifies the total sales for a specific period, including fees and VAT. The report contains three parts: a payment summary and specifications for sales and for fees.

##### Payment Summary

Provides a summary of the `Amount` sold, `Fees` and `VAT`. **If PayEx handles the settlement process**, the `Transfered``amount` - shown in the balance report summary is equivalent to the disbursement on the bank statement (the remaining total amount after fees).

##### Sales specification

Provides a specification over sales for the given period. The sales total is specified per payment area (`CreditCard, Direct Debit, Factoring`) and underlying payment instruments. Each sales row specify Quantity, Sum sales and Amount to pay out, the last one is only eligble **if PayEx handles the Settlement process**.

##### Fees specification

Provides a specification over fees for the given period. The fees total is specified per payment area (`CreditCard, Direct Debit, Factoring`) and underlying payment instruments. Each fees row specify `Quantity` (sales), `Amount` (sales), `Unit price`, `Provision` and `fee Amount`. **If you handle the settlement process yourselves you will receive a separat invoice for fees**.

#### Transactions List

The Transaction List (provided in `.xlsx` and `.xml` formats) specifies all transactions for a specific period, including a summary of transactions grouped by payment method. Both formats contain the same information, but the xml file is meant for computer processing while the excel workbook is meant for human interaction.

The first row contains the name of the PayEx company (e.g. PayEx Solutions AB) that the merchant has the contract with, and the balance report number. The header fields contain a summary of the transactions displayed in the body.

### Reconciliation

To do the reconciliation, you need to match the information in your system against the information provided by PayEx in the balance report and transaction list. Below is a sequence diagram detailing the interaction.

```mermaid

activate Merchant
activate PayEx.FrontEnd
activate PayEx.BackOffice
Merchant-->PayEx.FrontEnd: Online payment transactions
deactivate Merchant

PayEx.FrontEnd-->PayEx.BackOffice: Transaction data
deactivate PayEx.FrontEnd
deactivate PayEx.BackOffice

activate Merchant

PayEx.BackOffice->Merchant: Balance Report (PDF-file)
note left of BackOffice: files are sent by e-mail or file transfer
PayEx.BackOffice->Merchant: Transaction list (XLSX-file)
PayEx.BackOffice->Merchant: Transaction list (XML-file)
deactivate Merchant
```

**There are two ways** for you to match the information from your system with the information given in the reconciliation files from PayEx:

1. You can use information **generated by your** system (you will have to set a unique payeeReference when you make the transaction), or
2. You can use the transaction number **generated by PayEx** (this is called transaction number and is returned from PayEx after you have created the transaction).

A credit card transaction is made when you either make a capture or a reversal. In the input data for making a capture, you will set the `payeeReference`. The unique value of this field is the same as the field called `OrderID` in the reconciliation file.

```JS
{
    "transaction": {
        "amount": 1500,
        "vatAmount": 0,
        "description": "Test Reversal",
        "payeeReference": "ABC123"
    }
}
```

When you receive the response from PayEx, the response will includetransaction.number##. This is the same as the field `calledTransactionNo` in the reconciliation file.

```JS
{
    "payment": "/psp/creditcard/payments/5adc265f-f87f-4313-577e-08d3dca1a26c",
    "capture": {
        "id": "/psp/creditcard/payments/5adc265f-f87f-4313-577e-08d3dca1a26c/captures/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
        "transaction": {
            "id": "/psp/creditcard/payments/5adc265f-f87f-4313-577e-08d3dca1a26c/transactions/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
            "created": "2016-09-14T01:01:01.01Z",
            "updated": "2016-09-14T01:01:01.03Z",
            "type": "Capture",
            "state": "Initialized",
            "number": 1234567890,
            "amount": 1500,
            "vatAmount": 250,
            "description": "Test Capture",
            "payeeReference": "ABC123",
            "failedReason": "",
            "isOperational": false,
            "operations": []
        }
    }
}
```

* `payeeReference` sent to PayEx is equal to `OrderId` in the reconciliation file.
* `capture.transaction.number` returned from PayEx is equal to `TransactionNo` in reconciliation file.
