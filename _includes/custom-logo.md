## Custom Logo

If you have permission and the feature has been activated in your contract, you
can replace the Swedbank Pay logo in the Payment Menu. See the **abbreviated**
example below with `logoUrl` present in the `paymentOrder` request's `urls`.

*   If the configuration is activated and you add a `logoUrl`, the Swedbank Pay
    logo will be replaced and the text changed accordingly.

*   If the configuration is activated and you do not add a `logoUrl`, no logo or
    text will be shown.

*   If the configuration is deactivated, adding a `logoUrl` has no effect.
