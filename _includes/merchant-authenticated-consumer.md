**Delegated Strong Consumer Authentication** (hereby abbreviated as "Delegated
SCA") is performed as an alternative to [Checkin][checkin] when creating the
Payment Order upon the initialization of the [Payment Menu][payment-menu]. You
can only use Delegated SCA if you have an agreement with Swedbank Pay. The
additional `nationalIdentifier` field described below should be added to the
`paymentorder.payer` object already in the Payment Order creation request, as an
alternative to `consumerProfileRef`.

When the payer is authenticated by the Merchant, some payment instruments
will allow a more frictionless payment process. Invoice One-Click Payments does
not require the last 4/5 digits of the payer's social security number (SSN),
for instance.

Below you can see an example of the payment window with and without Delegated
SCA. In the first image, the SSN is removed altogether because the payer is
authenticated by the Merchant. In the bottom image, the last 4/5 digits of the
SSN are required as usual.
