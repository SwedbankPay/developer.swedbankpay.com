## Merchant Authenticated Consumer

{% include jumbotron.html body="When the consumer is identified and
authenticated by the merchant, the consumer's identity can be included in the
Payment Order request." %}

**Merchant Authenticated Consumer** is performed as an alternative to
[Checkin][checkin] when creating the Payment Order upon the initializaiont of
the [Payment Menu][payment-menu]. You can use Merchant Authenticated Consumer
only if you have an agreement with Swedbank Pay. The additional
`nationalIdentifier` property described below should be added to the
`paymentorder.payer` object already in the Payment Order creation request, as
an alternative to `consumerProfileRef`.

{% include alert.html type="warning" icon="warning" header="Bank ID
authentication required" body="In order to use the Merchant Authenticated
Consumer feature, you need a **legal agreement with Swedbank Pay** which
mandates that the consumer identified by the `nationalIdentifier` is
authenticated with **Bank ID** prior to the request." %}

An example of how a Merchant Authenticated Consumer request looks like is
provided below (abbreviated for brevity):
