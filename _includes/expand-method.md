## Expand the First Payment Method

A useful feature when customizing your payment UI, is auto-expanding the first
payment method in the menu. By doing this you can guide the payer towards a
specific payment method. This is done by adding the `boolean` field
`expandFirstInstrument` and set it to `true`. The first method will be expanded
when the payment UI is loaded. This can be used as a stand-alone feature, but
can favourably be paired with [customizing the order of the menu][cust-menu].

## Request Example

The request with `expandFirstInstrument` set to `true` should look like the
example below.

The field will not be visible in the **response**, so we will only include the
request here. The response will look like a basic `paymentOrder` response.
