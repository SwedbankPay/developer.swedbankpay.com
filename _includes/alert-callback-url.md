It is mandatory to set a [`callbackUrl`]({{ callback_href }}) in the `POST`
request creating the payment. When `callbackUrl` is set, Swedbank Pay will send
a `POST` request to this URL when the payer has fulfilled the payment. Upon
receiving this `POST` request, a subsequent `GET` request towards the `id` of
the payment generated initially must be made to receive the state of the
transaction.
