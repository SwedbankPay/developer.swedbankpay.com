The payment's VAT (Value Added Tax) `amount`, entered in the lowest monetary
unit of the selected currency. E.g.:
**`10000`** = `100.00` {{ currency }},
**`5000`** = `50.00` {{ currency }}.

The `vatAmount` entered will not affect the `amount` shown on the payment page,
which only shows the total `amount`. This field is used to specify how much of
the total `amount` the VAT will be. Set to `0` (zero) if there is no VAT
`amount` charged.

First convert newlines to '<br />', strip all newlines, split into an array
on '<br />' as a separator, then join the array back into a string separated
by ' ' (a space) and then strip extraneous space.

The dashes in the Liquid code tags remove output space. More on that here:

It's essential to have control over newlines in this file. If unintentional
newlines sneak into what's rendered by this include, it will break all tables
it is included in, so please beware.
