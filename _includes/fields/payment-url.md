The {% clink `paymentUrl` %}{{ url }}{% endclink %} represents the URL that
Swedbank Pay will redirect back to when the view-operation needs to be loaded,
to inspect and act on the current status of the payment, such as when the payer
is redirected out of the Seamless View (the `<iframe>`) and sent back after
completing the payment. `paymentUrl` is only used in Seamless Views and should
point to the page of where the Payment Order Seamless View is hosted. If both
`cancelUrl` and `paymentUrl` is sent, the `paymentUrl` will used.

The following chain of Liquid filters converts newlines to spaces and removes
extranous spaces.

It's essential to have control over newlines in this file. If unintentional
newlines sneak into what's rendered by this include, it will break all tables
it is included in, so please beware.
