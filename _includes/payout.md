## Payout

{% include jumbotron.html body="**Payout to Card** is an add-on service which
enables you to deposit winnings directly to the winner's card. This without
having to collect card details a second time." %}

## Introduction

*   The only acquirer for this service is Swedbank. You require a separate
    Swedbank acquiring number to ensure that payout transactions and regular
    card transactions are kept separate.
*   You need to have the 3-D Secure protocol enabled.
*   The service is available through a Swedbank Pay hosted payment page.
*   The current implementation is only available for gaming transactions
    (Merchant Category Code 7995).
*   The payout service is not a part of Swedbank Pay Settlement Service.

## API Requests

The API requests are displayed in the [payout flow](#payout-flow). Â You create
a payout by performing a `POST` creditcard payments with key `operation` set to
`payout`.
