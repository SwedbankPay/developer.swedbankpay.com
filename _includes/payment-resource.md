## Payment Resource

The `payment` resource is central to all payment instruments. All operations
that target the payment resource directly produce a response similar to the
example seen below. The response given contains all operations that are
possible to perform in the current state of the payment.

### Operations

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as
described here in the documentation.
Always use the `href` and `method` as specified in the response by finding
the appropriate operation based on its `rel` value.
The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of
the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request
for the given operation.
