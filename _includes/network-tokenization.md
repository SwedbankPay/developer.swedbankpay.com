## What Is Network Tokenization?

The thought behind network tokenization is to shift the processing of stored
cards from card numbers (PAN) to tokens. Card details are replaced by the token
and a cryptogram.

The tokens are generated by the card networks (Visa and MasterCard) when the
end-user signs up for a service using a stored card. Tokens are global within
the network, where Merchants, PSPs and issuers can connect to them. The merchant
and PSP are provided with the token attached to a card, while the issuer is able
to update the card information attached to the token. The result is a token
which lives after a card expires, since the card information connected to it is
updated seamlessly by the issuer.

This will improve the user experience for the end-user, as they no longer have
to take action when their card reaches the expiry date. As the card connected to
the token will be valid at all times, this will reduce churn and improve
approval rates for merchants and PSPs as well, especially for subscription and
one-click services.

## How It Works

This functionality is available through both our
[payment order implementations][payment-order] and [card implementation][card]
for [recurring transactions][recur], [one-click][one-click] and
[unscheduled purchases][unscheduled]. We strongly recommend `paymentOrder` to
ensure that you get access to capabilities coming in later deliveries, such as
card art, shared tokens and notifications. It is only available with Swedbank as
aqcuirer for the time being.

When you choose to add this functionality, we activate Network Tokenization for
your merchant account and initiate onboarding towards VISA and Mastercard. Once
we get onboarding confirmation from Visa and Mastercard, Network Tokenization
will be enabled and used for future card storage and stored card processing.
Cards that have previously been stored with card details only, will be network
tokenized next time they are charged.

Once the setup is completed, the transactions themselves run as normal
unscheduled, one-click or recurring purchases. The difference is that Network
Tokenization replaces the card number behind the token.

## Recommendations To You As A Merchant

*   If you are displaying the “last four” digits of the card number for your
    customers stored cards, we highly recommend refreshing these numbers when a
    card has been updated/replaced by the issuer. This would help the customer
    to understand that the new and valid card is stored. It is also recommended
    that you add some information that the card has been updated automatically
    by the issuer. Retrieving the updated card information is done using
    `payerOwnedTokens`, and should be done when the end-user logs in, goes to
    “My cards” or at a similar point that makes sense in your portal.

The `GET` request to retrieve these should look similar to this.

**GET Tokens Request**

```http
GET /psp/paymentorders/payerownedtokens/<payerReference> HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
```

Among the response fields for the relevant token, you should be able to find
these Network Tokenization related fields.

**GET Tokens Request**

```http
"instrumentParameters": {
       "expiryDate": "12/2025",
       "cardBrand": "Visa",
       "lastFourPan": "6981",
       "lastFourDPan": "8188",
       "issuerName": "BankName"
}
```

| :----------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------- |
| {% f instrumentParameters %}   | `integer` | A list of additional information connected to the token. Depending on the instrument, it can e.g. be `expiryDate`, `cardBrand`, `email`, `msisdn` or `zipCode`.|
| {% f expiryDate, 2 %}      | `string`  | The expiry date of the card currently connected to the network token.                                  |
| {% f cardBrand, 2 %}                 | `string` | The brand of the card currently connected to the network token.                                          |
| {% f lastFourPan, 2 %}               | `string`  | The last four digits of the PAN connected to the network token. |
| {% f lastFourDpan, 2 %}                 | `string` | The last four digits of the DPAN (Network Token).                                           |
| {% f issuerName, 2 %}               | `string`  | The name of the issuer. |

*   We advise you to implement automatic deletion of tokens when end-users
choose to end the service with the you. This is to avoid unnecessary cost on
your end, as you are invoiced monthly for each active token.

*   Please note the new field `maskedDpan` is present when using Network
Tokenization. DPAN is the Network token representing the card and thus,
`maskedDpan` is a masked version of the network token. It will only appear if
the card is tokenized by Visa or Mastercard. The end-user will not normally know
what `maskedDpan` is or that it’s being used, but you as a merchant need to keep
track of it. See the [Paid resource for cards][paid-resource-model].
