## Capture

The capture transaction is where you ensure that the funds are drawn from
the payer. This step usually takes place when the product has exchanged
possession. You must first do a `GET` request on the payment to find the
`create-capture` operation.

## Create Capture Transaction

To create a `capture` transaction to withdraw money from the payer's Vipps
account, you need to perform the `create-capture` operation.

### Capture Sequence Diagram

`Capture` can only be done on an authorized transaction. It is possible to do a
partial capture where you only capture a part of the authorized amount. You can
do more captures on the same payment up to the total authorization amount later.
