## 3-D Secure 2

When dealing with card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the
cardholder is an essential topic. 3-D Secure 2 is an improved version of the
old protocol, now allowing frictionless payments where transactions can be
completed without input from the cardholder. Therefore, there are certain fields
that should be included when implementing 3-D Secure 2. These are listed below
and can be seen in the abbreviated request example below.
