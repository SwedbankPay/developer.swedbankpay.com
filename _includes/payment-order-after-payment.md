## Operations

Most payment instruments are two-phase payments –
in which a successful payment order will result in an authorized transaction –
that must be followed up by a capture or cancellation transaction in a later
stage. One-phase payments like Swish are settled directly without the option to
capture or cancel. For a full list of the available operations, see the
[techincal reference][operations].

| Operation                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create-paymentorder-capture`  | The second part of a two-phase transaction where the authorized amount is sent from the payer to the payee. It is possible to do a part-capture on a subset of the authorized amount. Several captures on the same payment are possible, up to the total authorization amount. |
| `create-paymentorder-cancel`   | Used to cancel authorized and not yet captured transactions. If a cancellation is performed after doing a part-capture, it will only affect the not yet captured authorization amount.                                                                                         |
| `create-paymentorder-reversal` | Used to reverse a payment. It is only possible to reverse a payment that has been captured and not yet reversed.                                                                                                                                                               |

To identify the operations that are available we need to do a `GET` request
against the URL of `paymentorder.id`:

{:.code-view-header}
**Request**

```http
GET /psp/paymentorders/{{ page.payment_order_id }} HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
```

The (abbreviated) response containing an `updateorder`, `capture`,
`cancellation`, and `reversal` operation should look similar to the response
below:

{:.code-view-header}
**Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
