## {{ product }} Events

During operation in the {{ product }}, several events can occur. They are
described below.

{% include alert.html type="warning" icon="info" header="Event Overrides"
body="Adding an event
handler to one of the following events **overrides** the default event handler,
meaning your custom event handler will have to do what the default event handler
did. If you donâ€™t, the behaviour of the event is going to be undefined.
Just adding an event handler for logging purposes is therefore not possible, the
event handler will have to perform some functionality similar to the
event handler you are overriding." %}
