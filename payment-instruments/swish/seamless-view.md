  The **Seamless View** scenario gives your
  customers the opportunity to pay with Swish directly
  within your webshop. This gives the payer a
  frictionless experience as we are handling the
  payment in the implemented `iframe` on your page.

## Swish Seamless View integration flow

1.  When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request
   towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information.
   `view-sales` is a `rel` value in one of the operations, sent as a response
   from Swedbank Pay to the Merchant.
2.  `Open iframe` creates the Swedbank Pay hosted iframe.
3.  `Show payer UI page in iframe` displays the payment window as content
    inside of the iframe. The payer can insert mobile information for
    authorization.
4.  `Event: OnPaymentComplete` is when the payment is complete. Please note that
    both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to a
    cancelled payment.
5.  To get the transaction result, you need to follow up with a `GET` request
    using the `paymentID` received in the first step.
6.  If CallbackURL is set you will receive a payment callback when the Swish
    dialogue is completed, and you will have to make a `GET` request to check
    the payment status.

## Step 1: Create a Purchase

A `Purchase` payment is a straightforward way to charge the card of the payer.
You need to make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay as shown below to create
a purchase. An example of an expanded `POST` request is available in the
[other features section][purchase]. This will generate a payment object with a unique
`paymentID`. You will receive a **JavaScript source** in response.

The key information in the response is the `view-sales` operation. You will need
to embed its `href` in a `<script>` element. The script will enable loading the
payment page in an `iframe` in our next step.

{% include alert-nested-iframe-unsupported.md %}

## Step 2: Display the Payment Window

You need to embed the script source on your site to create a Seamless View in an
`iframe`; so that the payer can enter the required information in a secure Swedbank
Pay hosted environment. A simplified integration has these following steps:

1.  Create a container that will contain the Seamless View iframe: `<div
    id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">`.
2.  Create a `<script>` source within the container. Embed the `href` value
    obtained in the `POST` request in the `<script>` element. Example:

```html
<script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.dev.payex.com/swish/core/scripts/client/px.swish.client.js"></script>
```

The previous two steps gives this HTML:

{:.code-view-header}
**HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Swedbank Pay Seamless View is Awesome!</title>
        <!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file -->
        <script src=<YourJavaScriptFileHere>></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">
          <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.dev.payex.com/swish/core/scripts/client/px.swish.client.js"></script>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Lastly, initiate the Seamless View with a JavaScript call to open the `iframe`
embedded on your website.

{:.code-view-header}
**HTML**

```html
<script language="javascript">
    payex.hostedView.swish({
        // The container specifies which id the script will look for to host the
        // iframe component.
        container: "swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page"
    }).open();
</script>
```
