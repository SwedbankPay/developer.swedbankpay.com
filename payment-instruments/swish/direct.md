  Swish is a one-phase payment instrument supported by the major Swedish banks.
  In the Direct scenario, Swedbank Pay receives the Swish registered mobile
  number directly from the merchant UI. Swedbank Pay performs a payment that
  the payer confirms using her Swish mobile app.

## Payment Flow

*   When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request
    towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information.
*   The next step is to collect the payer's Swish registered mobile number
    and make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay to create a sales
    transaction.
*   Swedbank Pay will handle the dialog with Swish and the payer will have
    to confirm the purchase in the Swish app.
*   If `callbackURL` is set, you will receive a payment callback when the Swish
    dialog is completed.
*   Make a `GET` request to check the payment status.

## Step 2a: Create E-Commerce Sale Transaction

This operation creates an e-commerce sales transaction in the Direct payment
scenario. This is managed either by sending a `POST` request as seen below, or
by directing the payer to the hosted payment pages. Note that the `msisdn`
value (the payer's mobile number) is required in this request.

{:.code-view-header}
**Request**

```http
POST /psp/swish/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/sales HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "transaction": {
        "msisdn": "+46739000001"
    }
}

```

| :--------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `transaction`    | `object` | The `transaction` object contains information about the specific transaction.                     |
| └➔&nbsp;`msisdn` | `string` | The payer's mobile number. It must have a country code prefix and be 8 to 15 digits in length. |

{% include transaction-response.md transaction="sale" %}

## E-Commerce Purchase Flow

The sequence diagram below shows the two requests you have to send to
Swedbank Pay to make a purchase. The Callback response is a simplified example
in this flow. Go to the [Callback][callback-url] section to view the complete flow.

    activate Browser
    Browser->>-Merchant: Start purchase
    activate Merchant
    Merchant->>-SwedbankPay: POST <Swish payment> (operation=PURCHASE)
    activate  SwedbankPay
    note left of Merchant: First API request
    SwedbankPay-->>-Merchant: Payment resource

    activate  SwedbankPay
    SwedbankPay-->>-Merchant: Transactions resource

    Merchant->>-Browser: Tell payer to open Swish app

    activate  SwedbankPay
    SwedbankPay-->>-Merchant: Payment response
    activate Merchant
    Merchant->>-Browser: Payment Status
```

## Step 2b: Create M-Commerce Sale Transaction

This operation creates an m-commerce sales transaction in the Direct payment
scenario. This is managed either by sending a `POST` request as seen below, or
by directing the payer to the hosted payment pages. Note that the `msisdn`
value (the payer's mobile number) is left out in this request. The
`redirect-app-swish` operation is only present in the m-commerce flow response.

{:.code-view-header}
**Request**

```http
POST /psp/swish/payments/{{ page.payment_id }}/sales HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "transaction": {
    }
}
```

| :------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `transaction` | `object` | The  `transaction` object is empty for m-commerce sale transactions. |

{% include transaction-response.md transaction="sale" mcom=true %}
