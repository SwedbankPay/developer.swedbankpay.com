## Introduction

*   When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
  purchase process, you need to make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with
  your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
  `paymentID`. You will receive a **redirect URL** to a Swedbank Pay payment
  page.
*   You need to redirect the payer's browser to that specified URL so that the
  payer can enter the invoice details in a secure Swedbank Pay environment.
*   Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer's browser to - one of two specified URLs,
  depending on whether the payment session is followed through completely or
  cancelled beforehand. Please note that both a successful and rejected payment
  reach completion, in contrast to a cancelled payment.
*   When you detect that the payer reach your `completeUrl` , you need to do a
  `GET` request to receive the state of the transaction, containing the
  `paymentID` generated in the first step, to receive the state of the
  transaction.

## Step 1: Create The Payment

*   An invoice payment is always two-phased based - you create an
  `Authorize` transaction, that is followed by a `Capture` or `Cancel` request.

To initiate the payment process, you need to make a `POST` request to Swedbank Pay.
Our `payment` example below uses the [`FinancingConsumer`]
[financing-consumer] value. All valid options when posting a payment with
operation equal to `FinancingConsumer`, are described in
[features][financing-consumer].
