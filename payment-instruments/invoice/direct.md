## Invoice Direct implementation flow

1.  Collect all purchase information and send it in a `POST` request to Swedbank
   Pay. Make sure to include personal information (SSN and postal code).

2.  Make a new `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay to retrieve the name and
   address of the customer to create a purchase.

3.  Create a `POST`request to retrieve the transaction status.

4.  Send a  `GET` request with the `paymentID` to get the authorization result.

5.  Make a Capture by creating a `POST` request.

*   An invoice payment is always two-phased based - you create an Authorize
transaction, that is followed by a `Capture` or `Cancel` request.
The `Capture` , `Cancel`, `Reversal` opions are
described in [features][features].

{% include alert.html type="informative" icon="info" body="
Note that the invoice will not be created/distributed before you have
made a `capture` request. By making a Capture, Swedbank Pay will generate
the invoice to the payer and the order is ready for shipping." %}

The 3 most important steps in the Invoice Direct flow are shown below.

## Step 1: Create a Purchase

Our `payment` example below uses the [`FinancingConsumer`][financing-consumer] value.
