## Options After Posting A Payment

When you detect that the payer has reached your `completeUrl`, you need to do a
GET request on the payment resource, which contains the paymentID generated in
the first step, to receive the state of the transaction. You will also be able
to see the available operations after posting a payment.

*   **Abort:** It is possible to abort the process if the payment has no
  successful transactions. [See the `abort` description](#abort).
*   An invoice authorization must be followed by a `capture` or
  `cancel` request.
*   For reversals, you will need to implement the `reversal` request.
*   **If CallbackURL is set:** Whenever changes to the payment occur a [Callback
  request][callback-request] will be posted to the callbackUrl, which was
  generated when the payment was created.

## Cancellations

Perform the `create-cancellation` operation to cancel a previously authorized
or partially captured invoice payment.

## Cancel Response

The `cancel` resource will be returned, containing information about the
newly created `cancel` transaction.

{% include transaction-response.md transaction="cancel" %}

### List Cancel Transactions

The `cancellations` resource lists the cancellation transaction made on a
specific payment.

Host: {{ page.api_host }}
Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>
Content-Type: application/json
```

{% include transaction-list-response.md transaction="cancel" %}

### Cancel Sequence

A `cancel` can only be performed on a successfully authorized transaction which
has not been captured yet. If you perform a cancellation after doing a partial
capture, you will only cancel the remaining authorized amount.

  activate Merchant
  activate SwedbankPay
  SwedbankPay-->>Merchant: transaction resource
  deactivate Merchant
  deactivate SwedbankPay
```

## Reversals

The `create-reversal` operation will reverse a previously captured payment and
refund the amount to the payer. To reverse a payment, perform the
`create-reversal` operation.
