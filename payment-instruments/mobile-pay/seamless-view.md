  **Seamless View** scenario gives your payers the opportunity to pay with
  MobilePay directly from within your webshop. In the Seamless view scenario,
  Swedbank Pay receives a mobile number (MSISDN) from the payer through
  Swedbank Pay Payments. Swedbank Pay performs a payment that the payer then
  must confirm through the MobilePay mobile app.

## Step 1: Create A purchase

When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
purchase process, you need to make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with
your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
`paymentID`. An example of an abbreviated `POST` request is provided below. You
will receive a response in which you can find the **JavaScript source** in the
`view-payment` operation.

The key information in the response is the `view-payment` operation. You
will need to embed its `href` in a `<script>` element. The script will enable
loading the payment page in an `iframe` in our next step.

{% include alert-nested-iframe-unsupported.md %}

## Step 2: Display  the payment window

You need to embed the script source on your site to create a Seamless View in an
`iframe` so that the payer can enter the required information in a secure
Swedbank Pay hosted environment. A simplified integration has these following
steps:

1.  Create a container that will contain the Seamless View iframe: `<div
    id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">`.
2.  Create a `<script>` source within the container. Embed the `href` value
    obtained in the `POST` request in the `<script>` element. Example:

```html
    <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.externalintegration.payex.com/mobilepay/core/ scripts/client/px.mobilepay.client.js"></script>
```

The previous two steps gives this HTML:

{:.code-view-header}
**HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Swedbank Pay Seamless View is Awesome!</title>
        <!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file -->
        <script src=<YourJavaScriptFileHere>></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">
          <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.dev.payex.com/mobilepay/core/scripts/client/px.mobilepay.client.js"></script>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Lastly, initiate the Seamless View with a JavaScript call to open the `iframe`
embedded on your website.

{:.code-view-header}
**JavaScript**

```js
<script language="javascript">
    payex.hostedView.mobilepay({
        // The container specifies which id the script will look for to host the
        // iframe component.
        container: "swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page"
    }).open();
</script>
```

## MobilePay Online Seamless View flow

The sequence diagram below shows the two requests you have to send to
Swedbank Pay to make a purchase.
The links will take you directly to the API description for the specific
request.

```

1.  When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request
    towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information.
2.  `rel: view-payment` is a value in one of the operations, sent as a response
    from Swedbank Pay to the Merchant.
3.  `Open iFrame` creates the Swedbank Pay Seamless View.
    The Seamless View displays the payment page as content inside of the
    `iFrame`.
4.  A `POST` request is sent to the MobilePay API with
    the mobile number (optional) for authorization.
5.  Swedbank Pay handles the dialog with MobilePay and the payer confirms the
    purchase in the MobilePay app.
6.  After the purchase has been authorized, the payer will be redirected back
    to the merchant, where the status can be checked to ensure the payment was
    successful.

        prev_href="redirect"

        next_href="after-payment"
