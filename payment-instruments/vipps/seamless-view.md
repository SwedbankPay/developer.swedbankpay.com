  **Seamless View** scenario gives your
  customers the opportunity to pay with Vipps directly within your webshop.
  In the Seamless View scenario, Swedbank Pay receives a mobile number (MSISDN)
  from the payer through Swedbank Pay Payments. Swedbank Pay performs a payment
  that the payer must confirm through the Vipps mobile app.

## Step 1: Create a Purchase

When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
purchase process, you need to make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with
your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
`paymentID`. An example of an abbreviated `POST` request is provided below. You
will receive a response in which you can find the **JavaScript source** in the
`view-payment` operation.

The key information in the response is the `view-payment` operation. You
will need to embed its `href` in a `<script>` element. The script will enable
loading the payment page in an `iframe` in our next step.

## Step 2: Display the payment window

You need to embed the script source on your site to create a Seamless View in an
`iframe`; so that the payer can enter the required information in a secure
Swedbank Pay hosted environment. A simplified integration has these following
steps:

1.  Create a container that will contain the Seamless View iframe: `<div
    id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">`.
2.  Create a `<script>` source within the container. Embed the `href` value
    obtained in the `POST` request in the `<script>` element. Example:

```html
    <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.dev.payex.com/vipps/core/ scripts/client/px.vipps.client.js"></script>
```

The previous two steps gives this HTML:

{:.code-view-header}
**HTML**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Swedbank Pay Seamless View is Awesome!</title>
        <!-- Here you can specify your own javascript file -->
        <script src=<YourJavaScriptFileHere>></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page">
          <script id="payment-page-script" src="https://ecom.dev.payex.com/vipps/core/scripts/client/px.vipps.client.js"></script>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Lastly, initiate the Seamless View with a JavaScript call to open the `iframe`
embedded on your website.

{:.code-view-header}
**JavaScript**

```html
<script language="javascript">
    payex.hostedView.vipps({
        // The container specifies which id the script will look for to host the
        // iframe component.
        container: "swedbank-pay-seamless-view-page"
    }).open();
</script>
```

This is what the result should look like:

## Vipps Seamless View integration flow

The sequence diagram below shows the two requests you have to send to
Swedbank Pay to make a purchase.
The links will take you directly to the API description for the specific
request.

```

1.  When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request
   towards Swedbank Pay with the collected Purchase information.
2.  `rel: view-payment` is a value in one of the operations, sent as a response
   from Swedbank Pay to the Merchant.
3.  `Open iframe` creates the Swedbank Pay Seamless View.
     The Seamless View displays the payment page as content inside of the
   `iframe`. The payer can enter their mobile phone number for authorization.
4.  A `POST` request is sent to the Vipps API with the mobile number for
   authorization.
5.  The response will contain the state of the transaction. It will normally be
   `AwaitingActivity` in this phase of the payment, meaning we are awaiting a
   response from Vipps.
6.  Swedbank Pay handles the dialogue with Vipps and the payer confirms the
   purchase in the Vipps app.
