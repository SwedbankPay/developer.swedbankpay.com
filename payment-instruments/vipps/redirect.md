  **Vipps** is a two-phase
  payment instrument supported by the major Norwegian banks. In the redirect
  scenario, Swedbank Pay receives a mobile number (msisdn)
  from the payer through Swedbank Pay Payments. Swedbank Pay performs a payment
  that the payer must confirm through the Vipps mobile app.

## Introduction

*   When the payer starts the purchase process, you make a `POST` request
    towards Swedbank Pay with the collected `Purchase` information.
*   This will generate a payment object with a unique `paymentID`.
*   You will receive a Redirect URL to a hosted page.
*   You need to [redirect][reference-redirect] the payer to the Redirect payment
    where the payer must push the payment button.
    This triggers a `POST` towards Swedbank Pay.
*   The payer is redirected to a Vipps payment page to enter the mobile number.
*   Swedbank Pay handles the dialog with Vipps and the payer confirms the
    purchase in the Vipps app.
*   To receive the state of the transaction you need to do a `GET`
    request containing the `paymentID` generated in the first step.

You redirect the payer to collect the payer's mobile number.

## Step 2: Authorization

To create an authorization in the redirect flow, simply perform an HTTP redirect
of the payer towards the URL in the `href` of the `redirect-authorization`
operation found in the list of `operations` in the response from the creation of
the payment.

Once the payment is successfully authorized, the payer is returned to either the
`completeUrl` or the `cancelUrl`; depending on the action performed.
On the page as well as in the `callbackUrl` you need to perform an HTTP `GET`
request towards the `id` of the payment to inspect its status.

## Step 3: Get the transaction state

The `GET`request below will give you the transaction state of the payment.
The `paymentId` used below was provided in the fist step when creating a
purchase.
