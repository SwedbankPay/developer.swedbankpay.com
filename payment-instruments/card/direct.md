is up to each issuing bank and out of Swedbank Pay's control." %}

## Payment flow

Below is a quick stepwise summary of how the Direct Card Payment scenario works.

*   The payer places an order and you make a `Purchase` request towards Swedbank
  Pay with the gathered payment information.
*   The action taken next is the `direct-authorization` operation that is returned
  in the first request. You `POST` the payer's card data to the URL in the
  [`direct-authorization`][authorization] operation.
*   If the issuer requires 3-D Secure authentication, you will then receive an
    operation called `redirect-authentication`. You must redirect the payer to
    this URL to let them authenticate against the issuer's 3-D Secure page.
    *   When the 3-D Secure flow is completed, the payer will be redirected back to
        the URL provided in `completeUrl` or `cancelUrl`, depending on the actions
        performed by the payer.
    *   If the issuer does not require 3-D Secure authentication, the payment will
      already be `Completed` after performing the `direct-authorization`
      request. Note that `Completed` just indicates that the payment is in a
      final state; the financial transaction could be either OK or failed.
*   Finally you make a `GET` request towards Swedbank Pay with the `id` of the
  payment created in the first step, which will return the result of the
  authorization.

## Step 1: Create a Purchase

A `Purchase` payment is a straightforward way to charge the card of the payer.
It is followed up by posting a capture, cancellation or reversal transaction.

An example of an abbreviated `POST` request is provided below. An example of an
expanded `POST` request is available in the [other features section][purchase].

{% include alert.html type="informative" icon="report_problem" body="**Step 2** is
to create an authorization transaction. Implement only Step 2a if **3-D Secure
authentication is enabled**. Note that if the issuer does **not require** 3-D
Secure authentication, implement only Step 2b. You will see that the requests
are the same for both steps. The difference is in the operations, where Step 2a
has the `redirect-authentication` operation in its response. This is needed for
the payer to be redirected to complete the 3-D Secure authentication." %}

## Step 2a: Create authorization without 3-D Secure authentication

The `direct-authorization` operation creates an authorization transaction
directly.

If the issuer does not require 3-D Secure authentication, the payment will be
completed after the `direct-authorization` request and the `state` of the
`transaction` will be set to `Completed`. If the issuer requires 3-D Secure
authentication, read step 2b below for how to complete the authorization.

{% include alert.html type="informative" icon="info" header="Completed means final,
not successful." body="Note that `Completed` does not indicate a successful
payment, only that it has reached a final (complete) state. A `GET` request
needs to be performed on the payment to inspect it further." %}

## Step 2b: Create authorization with 3-D Secure authentication

If the issuer requires 3-D Secure authentication, the response from the
authorization request will contain a `redirect-authentication` operation and the
`state` of the `transaction` will be `AwaitingActivity`. This means that the
payer will have to be redirected to the issuer to complete the 3-D Secure
authentication. See the request and response examples below.

When you find the `redirect-authentication` operation in the response from the
authorization request, you will have to perform an HTTP redirect of the payer to
the URL of the `href` to complete the authorization by performing a 3-D Secure
authentication with the issuer.

When the 3-D Secure flow is completed, the payer will be redirected back to the
URL provided in `completeUrl` or `cancelUrl`, depending on the actions performed
by the payer.

## Options after posting a purchase payment

*   If the payment shown above is done as a two-phase (Authorization), you will
  need to implement the [Capture][capture] and [Cancel][cancel] requests.
*   {% include authorizations-timeout.md %}
*   **Abort:** It is possible to [abort a payment][abort] if the payment has no
  successful transactions.
*   For `reversals`, you will need to implement the [Reversal][reversal] request.
*   **Callback from Swedbank Pay:** Whenever changes to the payment occur a
  [Callback request][callback] will be posted to the `callbackUrl`, generated
  when the payment was created.
