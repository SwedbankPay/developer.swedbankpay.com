                      This option allow you to collect the card data on your
                      page. That implies that the process must be [PCI-DSS

*   When properly set up in your merchant/webshop site and the payer starts the
  purchase process, you need to make a `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay with
  your Purchase information. This will generate a payment object with a unique
  `paymentID`. You either receive a Redirect URL to a Swedbank Pay hosted
  page (Redirect integration) or a JavaScript source in response (Seamless View
  integration).
*   You need to [redirect][redirect] the payer's browser to that specified URL,
    or embed the script source on your site to create a Seamless View in an
    `iframe`; so that the payer can enter the credit card details in a secure
    Swedbank Pay hosted environment.
*   Swedbank Pay will handle 3-D Secure authentication when this is required.
*   Swedbank Pay will redirect the payer's browser to - or display directly in
    the `iframe` - one of two specified URLs, depending on whether the payment
    session is followed through completely or cancelled beforehand. Please note
    that both a successful and rejected payment reach completion, in contrast to
    a cancelled payment.
*   When you detect that the payer reach your `completeUrl` , you need to do a
  `GET` request, containing the `id` of the payment generated in the first step,
  to receive the state of the transaction.

You will redirect the payer to Swedbank Pay hosted pages to collect the credit
card information.

## Purchase Flow

The sequence diagram below shows a high level description of a complete
purchase, and the requests you have to send to Swedbank Pay. The links will
take you directly to the corresponding API description.

When dealing with card payments, 3-D Secure authentication of the cardholder is
an essential topic. By default, 3-D Secure should be enabled. Depending on
the card issuer, Swedbank Pay will check if the card is enrolled with 3-D
Secure. This process has two alternative outcomes:

*   If the card is enrolled with 3-D Secure, Swedbank Pay will redirect the
    cardholder to the authentication mechanism that is decided by the issuing
    bank. Normally this will be done using BankID or Mobile BankID.
*   If the card is not enrolled with 3-D Secure, no authentication of the
    cardholder is done.
