**Et voilà!** The payment should now be complete and
everyone should be happy. But, sometimes you also need to implement the
cancellation and reversal operations described in [After Payment][after-payment].

{% include iterator.html prev_href="payment-order"
                         prev_title="Back: Payment Order"
                         next_href="after-payment"
                         next_title="Next: After Payment" %}

[after-payment]: /payment-menu/after-payment
