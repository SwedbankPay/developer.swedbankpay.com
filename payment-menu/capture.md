**Et voil√†!** The payment should now be complete and
everyone should be happy. But, sometimes you also need to implement the

{% include iterator.html prev_href="payment-order"
                         prev_title="Payment Order"
                         next_href="after-payment"
                         next_title="After Payment" %}
