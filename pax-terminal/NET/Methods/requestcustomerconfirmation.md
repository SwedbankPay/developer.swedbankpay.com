title: RequestCustomerConfirmationAsync
description: Task\<CustomerConfirmationResult\> RequestCustomerConfirmationAsync(string message)
---

Call RequestCustomerAsync to ask customer a yes/no question. The message will be shown on the terminal's display together with a green and read button for yes and no. The method may only be called before or after a PaymentRequest has been sent to the terminal, which means it may be sent after a GetPaymentInstrument, but not during the actual payment which in general starts when the amount is known.

### Returns

A **CustomerConfirmationResult**

* `bool` **Confirmation** - Response from customer. True if yes and false if no.
* **NexoRequestResult**

```c#
public class NexoRequestResult
    {
        public string ResponseContent
        public NexoResponseResult ResponseResult { get; set; }
        public string ErrorCondition { get; set; }
        public string ResponseText { get; set; }
    };
```
