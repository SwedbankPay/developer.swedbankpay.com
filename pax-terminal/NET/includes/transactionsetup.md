description: TransactionSetup may be used as a parameter when starting a transaction.
---
TransactionSetup holds properties for a transaction and may be passed as an input parameter to functions that start a transaction sequence. All properties are not relevant depending on which function that is called.

```c#
 public interface ITransactionSetup
    {
        string AcquirerData { get; set; }
        decimal Amount { get; set; }
        string APMReference { get; set; }
        decimal CashBack { get; set; }
        string Currency { get; set; }
        string PaymentInstrument { get; set; }
        List<SaleItem> SaleItems { get; set; }
        bool SplitPayment { get; set; }
        string TransactionID { get; set; }
        PaymentTypes type { get; set; }

        string ToString();
    }
```
