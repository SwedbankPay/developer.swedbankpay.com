## Manually Entered Card Data

There is a possibility to send card data for payment from the sale system to the terminal. This applies only to non PCI regulated cards and the prefix of the card must be set up correctly in the parameters of the terminal. This is all done in the Terminal Management System. When that is in place it is just a matter of including the element `PaymentInstrumentData` in the `PaymentRequest`. Required attributes are `PaymentInstrumentType` set to `Card` and `EntryMode` set to `Keyed`.

Typical use for this is financing where where the cashier receives a reference to be entered.
