## Get Started

To start developing you need an A920Pro set up with embedded profile. To install and start your app you need to use `Android Debug Bridge`, ADB, so the terminal needs to have developer mode activated.

In production environment the business app is downloaded from TMS. Anything running in the terminal needs to be signed by Swedbank Pay.
